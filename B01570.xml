            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Or elſe in others it ariſes
<pb facs="tcp:179741:3"/> from the little love and regard they bear to Religion, and a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret favour for Atheiſm, upon which they deſign to keep all Divine Things under as groſs and courſe Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as may be, that ſo they may take advantage againſt them, as if they were of the ſame Leaven <hi>with Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane or Popiſh</hi> Fictions.</p>
            <p>To this purpoſe they are carried with great vehemency againſt the whole nature of Spirit, and particularly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Soul of man, as a diſtinct Being from the Body; well knowing the Doctrine of a Future State, is both aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained

            <p>Beſides, how doth it dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate from the Glory and Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the Divine Being, when for the denying the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituality
<pb facs="tcp:179741:4"/> of Mans Soul, all things are plunged down into the thick Matter, and the Nature of Spirit deemed an aiery and phantaſtick, or downright, an incompoſſible Notion; ſo that hereby <hi>all foundations are deſtroyed:</hi>

            <p>But now if the Soul of Man be, as particularly as may be, underſtood, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned into, in its Faculties and Operations; if its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, and continuing life and motion, after it leaves the Body be clearly aſſerted, and upon as great moments of Argument, as can be deſired, be demonſtrated; if its ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

            <p>Chriſt the <hi>wiſdom of God</hi> ſpake <hi>as never man ſpake.</hi> The <hi>Tongue of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> excels even as the <hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Adam</hi> underſtanding the natures of the Creatures, and fully comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, gave them fit names, and ſuch as carried the Images and very preſences of things imprinted upon them, as ſome ſounds now create the words that ſignifie them.</p>
            <p>Since ſo great a ruine of our natures in him, as our Reaſon is much declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and degraded, ſo is alſo our Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. For though words, becauſe they are known &amp; agreed upon to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie ſuch and ſuch things, call the mind to the conſideration of thoſe things; and the more advantagiouſly they are put together, the more they prevail; yet thoſe words, and our contexture of them are as much beneath the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Eloquence, as the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of men now fall below the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Innocency.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, ſtill according to the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:179741:9"/> Readvancement of the Underſtanding, ſo the Faculty of Diſcourſe riſes alſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solomon</hi> in his Wiſdom and clear Underſtanding, ſpoke with Grandeur of whole Nature, <hi>from the Cedar in Lebanon</hi> down to the <hi>Hyſſope that grows upon the Wall;</hi> and of all Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety and Morality, in words of greateſt acceptance and recommendation.</p>
            <p>And proportionable have been the Diſcourſes and Writings of the Men of Great Name for Learning and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in every Age.</p>
            <p>But in nothing is the Faculty of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe more maim'd and imperfect, than in Things of a Nature ſpiritual and retired from Body; and more eſpecially as they are Divine, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to God: Becauſe the knowledge of the Things themſelves is moſt loſt, and the Underſtanding ſo cramp'd concerning them.</p>
            <p>To be able therefore in ſuch Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to ſpeak ſo, as to <hi>compare Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things with Spiritual,</hi> that is, to obſerve the <hi>Decorum</hi> Spiritual Things require to be ſpoken with, there is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary the Divine Revelation of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and the aſſiſtance of the Holy Spirit: For ſo to ſpeak is that <hi>Divine</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:179741:10"/> 
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tterance, or Elocution,</hi> which the Apoſtle joins with Knowledge, and magnifies as an <hi>Act of Grace</hi> to Fallen man in order to his Recovery, deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from Jeſus Chriſt, the reſtorer of Humane Nature, and is in various degrees diſtributed to the profeſſors of Chriſtianity, and conveyed to them in the diligent Exerciſe of themſelves in Sacred Writings.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Dulneſs and Inattentiveneſs of Hearers makes things hard to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted, eſpecially things of great Retreat from ordinary Apprehenſion. We cannot ſpeak them plainly enough to make people conceive of them ſo as to be affected with them.</p>
            <p>Yet notwithſtanding we having ſo often occaſion to converſe with theſe great Sounds, <hi>A Soul, An Immortal Spirit,</hi> and its <hi>Eternal State,</hi> there is as great an obligation to ſearch the Things, as far as we can, leſt they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to us no more, than great ſounds without as great a Subſtance, whereas indeed their Subſtance and Reality exceeds their Sound how great ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
            <p>And to encourage us in this moſt induſtrious ſearch we are firſt to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:179741:10"/> to the Difficulty this Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That it is not ſo much the Unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligibleneſs of the things themſelves, as the want of a due Intention of Mind in our inquiries, as alſo an humble ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of our ſelves to the Divine Aſſiſtance that makes it ſo hard to ſpeak and hear of theſe Spiritual Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects as Wiſe men and Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>For Diſcourſes of them made up of ſuch words, <hi>as the ſpirit of God teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,</hi> jointed and put together by the ſame Wiſdom, and then aright receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, how ſignificant and potent would they be, how clearly repreſentative to the Underſtanding, how perſwaſive upon the whole Soul?</p>
            <p>And ſeeing in theſe things we have a kind of natural Knowledge and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, like <hi>Natural Arithmetique, and Mathematiques,</hi> (which yet being adorn'd and cultivated by Art are much improved) but eſpecially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we have the Word of God, ſo great a light to our feet, and lamp to our paths in our Diſcourſe concerning them, and the promiſe of the Bleſſed Spirit to aſſiſt our Inquiries into Truth, There is great reaſon of Confidence, the cloſer our Reſearches, and the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:179741:11"/> more induſtrious our Explanations of the things are, the brighter our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, and the more prevailing our Knowledge of them will grow, ſo as to enlighten and perſwade others alſo.</p>
            <p>Committing then this Undertaking to Divine Aſſiſtance, I have choſen this <hi>great aſſumption</hi> of <hi>Elihu</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Man,</hi> to reſt this Diſcourſe upon: <hi>There is a Spirit in Man, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of the Almighty giveth him <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not that the Soul of Man and its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Nature deriving it ſelf in Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation from God inſpiring it, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely, and in the firſt place here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, or the <hi>original</hi> proceeding of the <hi>Finite <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi> from the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the mighty Vigor and Force of this Spirit ſtirred up by God, and the Underſtanding acted to the Height by a more gracious inſpiration, enliven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, aſſiſting, and ſetting it on work in ſome peculiar perſons, and to ſome peculiar ends and employment, is that, which this <hi>Eloquent Reaſoner</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately means, and hath a particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to himſelf in it, as notably aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:179741:11"/> by God in his following Diſcourſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. Yet it plainly appears, he alludes to that <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the <hi>Firſt Creation,</hi> the <hi>Tradition</hi> of which, all Wiſe and Good men had conveyed, and aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them by undoubted Monuments, for it very much agrees with, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles that relation. <hi>There is a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in man,</hi> ſays <hi>Elihu, a mighty</hi> and <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 26.</note> 
               <hi>excellent Spirit; In the Image and Likeneſs of God,</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> deſcribes it. <hi>And the Breath of the Almighty giveth him underſtanding,</hi> as <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpeaks. Which in the words of <hi>Moſes</hi> is thus expreſſed, <hi>God breath'd into his Face</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 7.</note> 
               <hi>the Breath of Life, and Man became a living Soul.</hi> That Inſpiration gave that Soul of Life, whoſe Nature is <hi>

            </p>
            <p>And herein reſt fundamentally thoſe extraordinary Vigors of which <hi>Elihu</hi> here ſpeaks, when God by a <hi>ſecondary Donation</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> enables this <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderstanding</hi> to act like it ſelf, and to appear as it is.</p>
            <p>For all excellent motions of Soul inſpired by God into eminent perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, are but <hi>Fairer Exemplifications</hi> of <hi>Creation,</hi> and the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Nature</hi> of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:179741:12"/> mans Soul; So that while <hi>Elihu</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends ſomething further, he aſſures the main poſition, That Man in general hath a <hi>Great Spirit</hi> or <hi>Soul</hi> in him, and an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi> or <hi>Intellect</hi> given him by <hi>immediate inſpiration</hi> from God <hi>in Creation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To give then a deſcription of this <hi>Great Soul of man,</hi> as a foundation of the whole Treaty concerning it, I ſhall do it under theſe three following Heads.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As it is conſidered in its ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial and Eſſential Nature, and ſo I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe it: An <hi>Inviſible Spirit</hi> and <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal,</hi> made in the <hi>Image</hi> and <hi>Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God,</hi> and nearly allyed to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> the very Nobleneſs and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of mans Being above Brutes and Common matter.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As it is to be underſtood in its immediate Emanations, and Motions of it ſelf, and ſo it is <hi>An Intellectual Light,</hi> indued with all the powers of <hi>Rational</hi> and <hi>Moral Action.</hi> It is that by which a man breaths in the free and open Air of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and <hi>Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence:</hi> It is the principle of ſuch Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as is far above ſenſe, for if right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ordered, it bears the lofty Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:179741:12"/> of <hi>Good, Holy, Virtuous;</hi> and becauſe it cannot ſink upon a Common level, if diſorderly and irregular, it carries the black indeed, but <hi>Tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous names</hi> of <hi>Sin, Wickedneſs, Vice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. As it is to be known in its <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments,</hi> and ſo, It is that which taſtes, and enjoys all Good, or feels and endures, diſcerns and perceives Evil, and Miſery. If that be well, the whole is well; If that be wounded, and in Torment, there can be no Eaſe, or Remedy; And it is prepared to be a Great, and Ample <hi>Receipt</hi> of, and a moſt vehement Agent in its own <hi>Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Happineſs or Miſery.</hi> This Soul is that, which is <hi>Eternally Happy or Miſerable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though this Spirit be hid in the Body, and the Body ſeems to be <hi>All;</hi> yet it can indeed do nothing, nor feel any thing, but as the Soul does by it; and this Body, becauſe as it is now, it is an Inſtrument unfit, is laid aſide in Death, without any prejudice to the Souls <hi>Action,</hi> or <hi>Reſentment;</hi> but to the unſpeakable Exaltation of it: and at laſt a Body more fit for its uſe is giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to it, and which is every way pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion'd to its ſtate, whether of <hi>Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs or Miſery.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:179741:13"/>
            <p>Now whoſoever ſhall well weigh, and conſider this Soul, will ſtand amazed at the little value of it among men, (who profeſs to believe ſuch, or like repreſentations of it) and will oblige himſelf to a far higher Eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, and care for it, there being no other reaſon to be rendred, why ſo great and worthy a <hi>Part,</hi> or to ſpeak more properly <hi>a Mans True ſelf</hi> ſhould be neglected, but what is to be imput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to extreme madneſs, ſuch as a mans Throwing himſelf into Seas, or Flames, or Starving himſelf, contrary to all Laws of <hi>Self-preſervation</hi> would be; except that this Soul flies ſo much from it ſelf, as it judges by ſenſe, and is ſo hidden in the body, by acting ſo much, not only by it, but for it, that it appears <hi>wholly Body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And men being unwilling to put themſelves upon ſevere Reaſon to be aſſured of it, and very incredulous of Divine Revelation, that elſe gives a more eaſie and ſudden Certainty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it; they will not believe it is any thing but <hi>Body,</hi> and ſo with <hi>Soul</hi> deny <hi>Soul,</hi> preferring Body only, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Soul is moſt ſenſible, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, as it acts, and inſpires that, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:179741:13"/> loves, and is pleaſed with it ſelf moſt, as ſo active, and therefore wilfully conſents to its own Eclipſe by Body.</p>
            <p>To remove therefore this prejudice, I begin with the firſt part of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, That the Soul is <hi>Inviſible,</hi> and ſo to diſcourſe it, that it may appear, that <hi>Inviſible</hi> put into the Souls Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter is ſo far from a derogation to the Soul, that it is a great Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to its Nature. For the moſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent order, and ſtate of Beings, is of Beings Inviſible; Beings not ſeen with the Eye, nor felt with the Hand, nor approached to by Senſe; Beings whoſe operations give aſſurance to Reaſon and Faith they are, and of what degree of Efficacy they are, an Effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy far ſurpaſſing all viſible Agents, even to <hi>Infinite,</hi> of which even Senſe may and muſt be witneſs in multitude of Effects, though the Cauſes themſelves, and the manner of their working be indiſcernible by Sight or Senſe.</p>
            <p>And now I am ſpeaking of <hi>Things Inviſible</hi> in contra-diſtinction to things <hi>of Sight and Senſe,</hi> I would uſe this occaſion to make the way fairer to all that may be after ſaid, by taking an account of the way, by which Senſe
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:179741:14"/> comes to its cognizance of Things, and where it ſtops, and can go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and how Reaſon and Faith pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed ſtill, and go infinitely beyond.</p>
            <p>By Senſe I underſtand that Power of Soul, that moves towards, and takes in the perception of Things by the due motion of Bodily Organs fitted thereto; the objects of which are Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily and Material alſo: and though it be the Soul that acts by theſe Organs, and ſo is the true original, and laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort of Senſe; which appears in that though Body, or any part of it be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly impreſſed by Matter; yet if the Soul be buſie, and much taken up elſewhere, no Senſe follows, at leaſt till the Soul is more at leiſure, and can give attendance to Body, or that part of it ſo imprinted: Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this, yet becauſe the Action ſpoken of, is immediately performed by matter upon matter, and Bodily Nature meets in both, the knock of the one againſt the other is ſo forcible, and with ſuch remark to the Soul, that dwells within, and cannot but take notice, as gives us greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, and aſſurance in the reſult; and nothing ſeems more Certain and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:179741:14"/> Undenyable, than things ſo atteſted to us, who are ſo far ſunk down into Bodily Nature, the Soul (as I have already intimated) being moſt ſatisfied in its own Acts by, and upon Body.</p>
            <p>Now Sight is comprehenſive of all Senſe, becauſe Senſe turns it ſelf, as much as it can, to every object by Sight, being the moſt Excellent of Senſes; and the other Senſes quicken, and engage Sight, as much as may be: ſo that Inviſible Beings, and Beings unaccountable to Senſe are much of the ſame avail in ſignification, as to what concerns this Caſe. In ſumm then, Things of a Bodily Groſſneſs are thoſe only, that fall within the line of Senſes Communication, and are termed Viſible.</p>
            <p>But Reaſon is a Power, and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion beyond Senſe, it ſelf being the ſtream of a Pure and Immaterial Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, it winds it ſelf in, where matter, that Senſe acts by, cannot enter, and through the outward Rind or Matter, it paſſes into what lies within, &amp; where Matter hath neither made, nor receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any Impreſſion, yet there it divines by its own proper Sentiments, making
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:179741:15"/> uſe and advantage, and receiving Service from Senſe, ſo far as it is able to go, it leaves it, where it can go no farther, and when it hath ſearched be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond it, it can again compare the fruits of that ſearch with ſenſible and experimental Evidences, and ſo work by Senſe, and with it, and alſo above it, and beyond it; yea and even with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. Faith yet far exeeds Reaſon alone, by receiving Oracles from the Higheſt Reaſon and Underſtanding, God himſelf; whoſe infinity of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge leaving our Span of Knowledge at unmeaſurable diſtances behind it, gives trueſt and fulleſt accounts of all Things, and by believing what he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals, we receive the Benefit of his All Comprehending Knowledge.</p>
            <p>This general Premiſal being given, I come to argue the thing it ſelf, That Inviſible Beings are not the leſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are Inviſible, but they are upon true Inquiry found to be the Greateſt of Beings, and therefore the Greater, becauſe they are Inviſible.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Argum. </seg>1</label> There are many and Great Effects, that the Senſes every day converſe with, and becauſe they ſo eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, and are ſo well acquainted
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:179741:15"/> with them, we call them Senſes, or powers of Perception; and yet by the utmoſt Search and Inquiry Reaſon can put them upon, it cannot find out by them Cauſes potent enough for theſe Effects.</p>
            <p>When we ſurvey the whole World, and all the Creatures in it, and their ſo Lively and Vigorous, and yet ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently govern'd Motions, we are Judges of the Things themſelves by Senſe, and they cannot be denied: but Senſe can offer no Cauſe high enough for theſe effects, we muſt needs therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude by the Suffrage of Reaſon, There is ſome Cauſe unſeen, that is the ſpring of All. For the Determinations of Reaſon are, that till we come to the firſt Cauſe, every Thing muſt have a Cauſe, and that the Cauſe muſt be ſuperior to the Effect in that thing, wherein it is the Cauſe of it; when therefore there is an Effect, to which no ſeen Cauſe is able and ſufficient, there muſt be ſome unſeen Cauſe that does produce it.</p>
            <p>If a man ſhould hear from a Tree, or Beaſt, the voice of Words, and Humane Diſcourſe, how readily would he Conceive ſome higher original of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:179741:16"/> that Speech, and thoſe Words, than that Beaſt, or Tree?</p>
            <p>If then we obſerve ſuch a World, and Government of it, as muſt needs proceed from a Counſel, and Reaſon, a Prudence, and Underſtanding, arm'd with a power, and unbounded puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance, and we ſee none high enough thereunto, we cannot but conclude, There muſt be ſtill ſome Cauſe as high as theſe Effects, however it be Inviſible to us.</p>
            <p>For when we take account of all the Beings here, we eaſily grant, the moſt Conſiderable for ſuch Effects is Man, his Reaſon and Providence were moſt likely to ſummon things ſo toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to keep them in their order; but we preſently find he neither hath a Might, nor a Knowledge ſufficient. Not a Might, for the Heavens above him are far out of his Reach, or any appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation he can make to them. The Earth under him is too big for any of his Engines to diſpoſe. The Waters about him are altogether out of his Graſp, and all that he can poſſibly do in the ſumm of theſe, is plainly juſt nothing at all. His utmoſt attempt is to obtain what advantages he can to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:179741:16"/> himſelf from them, according to the nature wherein they are already fix'd and ſettled; And as for his knowledge of them, it is but as a ſpan to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, he ſearches and pries, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives but a very little, and his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Knowledge is to know his own Ignorance, ſo impoſſible it is he ſhould be either the Author or Conſervator of them.</p>
            <p>But oh how prodigious is it to think, Things ſhould by ſome lucky Hit caſt themſelves as by a Throw in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Order and Harmony!</p>
            <p>For Chance provides not for every circumſtance of any thing, or if it ſhould hit ſo well throughout in one Thing, in how many would it miſs? But we ſee things great and ſmall, and without number, ordered with ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act a Care and Contrivance, and among them very many little Things, upon which yet great conſequences and conveniencies depend, that none but a moſt excellent Mind could fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt or provide for ſome very great and deſigning Architect; and it ought to be no prejudice againſt him, that we do not ſee him.</p>
            <p>When any one ſtands on a Tower,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:179741:17"/> and ſees upon the Sea a Ship gallantly Equipped, with its Sails, Maſts, and all the various Tackling of it, and when by ſettled obſervation he finds it moves with Deſign and Inſtruction, and if he ſhould further know, it at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends certain and ſtable Rules, though the Pilot and Sailors are not ſeen, nor the Artificer that built it, nor the Owner that deſigns with it; yet could he think that there neither are, nor were ſuch, but that all this is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance of Accident, becauſe he ſees nothing but the Ship?</p>
            <p>While then Naturaliſts obſerve ſuch an Earth floating in the Air, and a World ſwimming in the boundleſneſs of Imaginary Space, and keeping yet thoſe juſt Rules by which all things move; ſhould it be any reaſon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude becauſe he ſees none able to guide this Frame, There is none?</p>
            <p>Is it not rather to be concluded, There is an Inviſible ſupreme Cauſe?</p>
            <p>If a man were firſt caſt upon a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, and after ſhould come to a City adorned with Temples, Palaces, Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Structures, all of great Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Proportion and Order, and ſhould yet find no Inhabitants, but what are
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:179741:17"/> beneath the wiſdom of ſuch a magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence; would he ſo much as ſuſpect, this was a fortuitous convention of the Materials into ſuch an Union, and not preſently reſolve? There are or have been perſonages equal to the work they ſee, although they ſee not them.</p>
            <p>When a man is in an empty Room, ſees no man, but hears the voice of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Reaſon and Diſcourſe, he will conclude; A Man however placed out of ſight, or a Greater than a Man is there.</p>
            <p>And why then ſhould we ſo much as ſurmize, Effects far greater than theſe ſhould have been wander'd into by an incertain up and down Rolle, or Frisk of Things?</p>
            <p>And if we allow there is ſo great, though an unſeen Cauſe of all thoſe Things, we may allow alſo, it is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than any of thoſe things that are ſeen, not only becauſe it is their Cauſe, but becauſe it hath reached thoſe Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects that none of them can extend themſelves unto, and have great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be aſſured, the Cauſe is the greater for being ſeen only in its Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and not in it ſelf; ſeeing thoſe things that are ſeen, have ſome ſuch
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:179741:18"/> diſadvantages upon them, whatever they are, that they cannot work, as this unſeen Cauſe hath done; and therefore further we have reaſon to believe, that their very being ſeen is one of thoſe diſadvantages, and that which runs through all the reſt; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we cannot find in a whole world of viſible Beings any one, that can work like this inviſible Cauſe; and therefore that it appertains to it to be inviſible, that it may be a Cauſe ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal; of both which it is no hard thing to conceive the account.</p>
            <p>For that things may fall under ſenſe they muſt be groſs, and ſo are cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſom, ſhut out of things by their own unfitneſs for penetration, capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of oppoſition, ſubject to diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They muſt alſo be of a ſlow, confined, reſtrained nature: But things purer, and not condeſcending to ſenſe may be free from theſe; and whatever is the ſoveraign Cauſe of all, muſt be ſo, for he muſt be of an excellency of power, perfectly free, and diſ-incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, of an infinitely quick motion, too high for oppoſition, more intimate to things than themſelves, for <hi>he is over all, in all, through all,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:179741:18"/> muſt be alſo ſo tranſcendently pure, as not to fall under <hi>dull</hi> and <hi>ſlow-ſighted ſenſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if there be one unſeen Being, there may be more, and they that are, not be the leſs, becauſe they are not to be ſeen, but the greater, reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling in ſome degree the excellency of that ſuper-inviſible Being, <hi>whom no man hath ſeen nor can ſee,</hi> and ſuch a one we affirm the Soul of man to be.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Argum. </seg>2</label> When we come to man himſelf, we perceive evidently, and undeniably by our ſenſes, and thoſe concluſions we make from them, as certain, as themſelves, how high, and great the effects of Humane Reaſon and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding are; what huge and orderly contrivances of all ſorts have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed by men, what Laws, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, Collections of knowledge have been, and are continually extant among them; what aſpiring of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and devout thoughts, as ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſearches and attempts beyond this world, and that all theſe are without parallel among all the reſt of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures under heaven.</p>
            <p>Now what is there in man, that is ſeen, to the function of which we
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:179741:19"/> would intruſt theſe offices and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations? Who can believe the Eye, or Tongue, or Hand could of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves contribute to any of theſe things in the firſt plot or device of them? or if we look into all the inward parts of humane body, that Anatomy pryes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, which of them can be fit for ſo great an employment? or how can the whole frame amounting from no higher particulars conſpire one part with another into ſo high atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? How notoriouſly are all the pretences made for any of them baffled by true Philoſophy? ſo that there muſt be ſome other Architect of them, though out of ſight.</p>
            <p>What an excellency is there in man above beaſts? Their higheſt motions, and ſuch as we admire for their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to Humane Reaſon (except ſuch wherein the wiſdom of the God of Nature is immediately ſeen) ſtoop as much below thoſe of men, as the faint light of the Moon falls below the luſtre of the Sun, or as the untuned, unmodelled ſound of a muſical Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made by a vulgar Hand, or wild Notes, come ſhort of the Muſick and Harmony of ſome excellent Artiſt, or
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:179741:19"/> as the gameſom leaps and rebounds of wild Creatures differ from the meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and becoming moves of a moſt orderly Dance. And yet the Bodies of men, and the Organs of ſenſe in them differ ſo little from thoſe of Beaſts in relation to the main of theſe great ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, that when we conſider man in the majeſtickneſs of true Reaſon and Underſtanding, and ſee ſo little upon his body, more than in theirs, we cannot but acknowledge ſomething divine within him, that, as we may ſay with reverence to the higheſt Majeſty, ſits as a God there. The Body is a Palace, or Temple indeed compared with the bodies of Beaſts, but this ſhews it only to be the Reſidency of ſo great an Inhabitant, and in ſome pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarities it may be ſo framed, as to be prepared thereby to be the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſo great an Artiſt, but both ſignifie as little to the immediate ſource of Reaſon, as a ſtately Houſe, or more curious Inſtrument do to the Offices or Diſcharges of the Maſter of the Houſe or Art, the magnificence and prudence of the one, the exactneſs and curioſity of the other. To this we muſt ſtill recourſe, <hi>There is a ſpirit</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:179741:20"/> 
               <hi>in man, and the breath of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty gives him underſtanding, and teacheth him more than the beaſts of the field, and maketh him wiſer than the fowls of heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet it is hard to perſwade any ſerious conſiderer, that the utmoſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts and endeavours of matter can ariſe to the performance of the duties of very Senſe in theſe brute Creatures, how much leſs can it to thoſe of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in man? In man then we ſee effects, that witneſs enough ſome great Cauſe, and Original we ſee not; yet ſtill ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Effects are plainly greater, than we can attribute to any thing, that may be ſeen in man, this Cauſe, becauſe not to be ſeen, is not leſſer than other things in man, that are to be ſeen, but greater, (and therefore greater for not being to be ſeen) becauſe it is not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the inabilities of thoſe parts of man, we can ſee, and yet cannot aſcribe the Effects to, becauſe they are ſo much above them.</p>
            <p>And yet too we might well expect theſe great Effects from the viſible parts of an Humane Body, if any where, ſeeing man is the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of the viſible Creatures, we know;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:179741:20"/> but as we reaſoned before, in ſpeaking of the firſt Cauſe, All things that are ſeen are too impure, and unweildy to conduct things to ſo great ends, as thoſe of Reaſon and Intelligence: and ſo not enough to act in the likeneſs of the firſt Cauſe, which likeneſs we muſt all along obſerve, as the true Key of the knowledge of mans Soul. </p>

            <p>A Drug hath not its nature from its ſhape, colour, or common circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, wherein it may agree, or be exceeded by other things of leſs vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, or by thoſe of its own kind, that have loſt their virtue, though they may ſtill have the outward ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances; but there is ſomething with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, that is not to be pored upon by Senſe, but is pierced to by Reaſon and Underſtanding. The appearance of Gold counterfeited deceives the Eye, but is detected by the <hi>Reaſon,</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:179741:21"/> that tryes things themſelves. If any thing be painted ſo to the life, that it cheats the ſight, and ſeems to be the very thing that it diſſembles, yet it is never the more the thing. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an unſeen nature, from which every thing hath its virtue. Hence it appears, there is a great retirement of that which is the Kernel of theſe Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, from outward garbs, lineaments, appearances, and it fairly leads us to the belief of Beings inviſible, whoſe whole nature and beings are hidden from Senſe, but only in their operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, wherein they exceed ſo much, as to recompenſe, with that evidence of themſelves, the retreat of their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings from fight.</p>
            <p>For if thoſe poorer things, whoſe pretence is ſmall, and their effects low, and their eſſence but a <hi>duly prepared matter,</hi> and ſo muſt for the moſt part lye open to Senſe, have yet a ſecret of their eſſence in reſerve, and made ſolemn by a vail of ſecrecy drawn over them; how reaſonable is it to think, the higheſt operations ſhould have their ſeat in Beings wholly immateri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and inviſible, of which the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme, God, is known to Senſe only
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:179741:21"/> by effects, and the Souls of men the loweſt of them, by acting in and by viſible and material Bodies indeed, yet in their operations and trueſt nature wholly independent upon them?</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Argum. </seg>4</label> The appearances like to men in Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, <hi>Inviſible Beings</hi> have ſometimes put on, and the great effects they have wrought in ſuch, or any other appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances to Senſe, as demonſtrations of themſelves to it, perſwade the reality of their Beings, and the greatneſs of them.</p>
            <p>For by ſuch addreſſes, and ſuch kind of effects, as are the moſt aſſuring cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentials to men, as they are now in Bodies, they have given to ſenſe and ſight great ſatisfaction, and notices of themſelves, and at the ſame time awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened Reaſon to obſerve, they were ſome unuſual and ſtranger Beings, and not familiar and ordinary ones, and that they took up a ſhort lodging on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in theſe appearances, to put Senſe out of doubt concerning themſelves.</p>
            <p>For in the mean time, to make it plain to Reaſon, that they exceeded the force of all viſible things, and were not tyed to act by their propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or ſo much as by the rule the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:179741:22"/> Soul of man in the body acts by, they have always contrived into ſome part, or circumſtance of their appearances, or the effects they wrought, tokens of their ſpirituality and grandeur; they did ſomething <hi>wonderful,</hi> ſo that while they have deſcended to ſenſe, they have alſo amazed it, and one way or other unriddled their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe. From whence ariſe theſe plain characters of <hi>Inviſible Beings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The reality of their Beings, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their inviſibility, ſeeing they can, as they pleaſe, demonſtrate themſelves by the way of Senſe, and aſſume viſibility not to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves more real, but more known to men, that otherwiſe being in body judge at diſadvantage of thoſe out of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Their independency upon <hi>viſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> ſeeing they could do all out of that viſible appearance they do in it, and do indeed much more out of it, than they do in it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Their preference of <hi>inviſibility</hi> to <hi>viſibility,</hi> ſeeing they appear only a ſhort time. Body to higheſt and trueſt Beings is inconſiderable, though it ſeem great to us; eſpecially thoſe
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:179741:22"/> groſs and dull ones we converſe in, or are to converſe with, and it is in greateſt indulgence to us, that they ſtoop down into them, as wiſe men ſometimes comply a little while with the fanſies and humours of children.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Their ſuperiority to <hi>viſible Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> in that they form their appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances with ſome extraordinaries, or do things ſo great in them, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them to be of a higher order.</p>
            <p>Now for the aſſurance of theſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, I eſpecially reſt upon the Hiſtories hereof in the Scripture, thoſe ſenſible evidences of the Divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, the appearances of the good Angels recorded in it, which are ſo many, and ſo plain, as to make up a full proof of <hi>inviſible Beings,</hi> and not ſo much as, with any likelihood of truth, to be eluded by thoſe, who profeſs to believe thoſe ſacred Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords.</p>
            <p>The ſallies of evil Angels upon the world, and the poſſeſſions they took of the bodies of men, doing things in them beyond the general Laws of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, related alſo to us in Scripture, may be reduced hereunto.</p>
            <p>As additional proof hereof, we may
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:179741:23"/> entertain thoſe memories of ſuch ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances in common ſtory, that are writ with greateſt judgment, ſobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and arguments of veracity.</p>
            <p>Now all this is applicable to the Souls of men thus far, firſt as it gives a common proof there are <hi>Inviſible Beings,</hi> of which order we affirm the Soul to be; and ſecondly, ſeeing the Soul was made in the Image of God, and in an allyance with Angels, it hath a ſubſtantial greatneſs like them; laſtly, it muſt, as they, be independent it ſelf upon matter, and have a force much above it, though it be for a time ſubjugated to the laws of a Body, and ſo cannot ſhew it ſelf in its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, till it be in a ſeparated ſtate, or joined to a Body more ſuited to its operations.</p>
            <p>If any ſhould ſay, why are not theſe appearances more frequent and uſual? The anſwer is, That were altogether unſuitable to the ſtate and majeſty of theſe <hi>inviſible Beings;</hi> which like that of the Eaſtern Princes, ſtands much in retirement, and as they were rarely ſeen, and not but upon great occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, when they had weighty deſigns to manage, or when it had been called
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:179741:23"/> into queſtion, whether they were alive or not, becauſe not ſeen for ſome ſpace of time. Thus inviſible Beings, good and holy, have in viſible ſhapes, though rarely, viſited the ſublunary world, and for great ends of ſervice to God, and alſo that they might thereby refute atheiſtick and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving conceipts, and give aſſurance of themſelves.</p>
            <p>Unholy ſpirits chained up by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power appear but at command, ſo often and no oftner than God plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; for it may be ſuppoſed the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil would not thus appear but upon neceſſity and conſtraint laid upon him by Divine Providence, becauſe his Kingdom ſuffers ſo much by the knowledge of Beings removed from ſenſe, yet when he muſt appear, it is moſt agreeable to ſo inſolent a Spirit, to do it to exceſs, and with greateſt troubleſomneſs, if not reſtrained by God.</p>
            <p>But God for the general in this ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Age of the world, and under the ſettled light of the Goſpel, teaches mankind by rational and intellectual evidences, that are ſo eaſily to be drawn into obſervation by us, and by
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:179741:24"/> thoſe clear and ſpiritual documents given us in his Word; eſpecially ſince ſuch a teſtimony, as hath been granted to men, of heavenly and inviſible powers in a humane body, acting with a virtue ſo divine, and miraculous, and ſo apparent to ſenſe.</p>
            <p>For what could be greater, than the whole Hiſtory of the Life and Death, the Reſurrection and Aſcenſion of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt</hi> our Lord, to all that are indeed Chriſtians, an inviſible power tranſacting ſo lively before ſenſe, all thoſe ſo high demonſtrations of it ſelf, and then framing and propagating a Doctrine every way agreeable to it ſelf, and ſpreading it through the whole world?</p>
            <p>If notwithſtanding all this the man of Senſe will not apprehend, nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept any proof of ſuch Beings, except our Senſes were daily Spectators of them; he very ridiculouſly exacts the tryal of thoſe things by Senſe, which are plainly affirmed to be out of the compaſs of Senſe, and all its reach; he demands to ſee and touch, that which cannot be ſeen or felt.</p>
            <p>Now it is certain, that which is out of the ſphere of any faculty whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:179741:24"/> cannot be tryed and judged by that faculty, any more than the eye can judge of ſounds, or the ear of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, or light be heard, or an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent noiſe of muſick be ſeen. Senſe ought not to be called to ſit in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon things that are above it, as finite knowledge cannot meaſure the poſſibilities of omnipotency. Ants may as well be conſulted with, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Palace may be built over their heap, or Beaſts decide, whether there be any reflexes of Reaſon, as Senſe be put to judge thoſe things, that are only to be diſcerned by Reaſon, or to meaſure by an unequal Reaſon, what Faith, which is Reaſon advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by Revelation, can alone give us an account of.</p>
            <p>How liberal an allowance is it to Senſe, that there is in ſo many parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, as we have already taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, a foundation laid in it for Reaſon and Faith to ground their fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſearch, and aſſurances upon?</p>
            <p>And as for the great perverſeneſs of ſuch men, that would make Senſe uſurp higher, and their preſumptions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt inviſible Beings in the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of that, the ſager conſents of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:179741:25"/> wiſe, learned, and pious men, and the general inclination the univerſality of mankind have diſcovered to a belief of ſuch Beings, make thoſe preſumptions appear no other, than a diffidence or diſtruſt in every thing but Senſe, and is no more conſiderable, than a Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks ſuſpicion of other things, moſt aſſured to other men by ſenſe it ſelf, or an ignorant mans difficulty to believe the Sun and Stars any bigger than they ſeem to be.</p>
            <p>From this Diſcourſe of Inviſible Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings <note place="margin">Inference.</note> very juſtly ariſes an expoſtulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with our ſelves, for our irreligious brutiſhneſs and ſenſuality, that we do not more mind theſe inviſible natures, and conſider God, our Souls, the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſtate, our neglect chiefly ariſing, becauſe they are not ſeen, although we have other great aſſurances of them. As Beaſts, we are only affected with what ſtrikes our Senſe.</p>
            <p>But let us obſerve every thing, the more inviſible it is, that indeed of the greater force and efficacy it is. The Spirits of things lye hid, and conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the eye, till they iſſue out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to operation.</p>
            <p>There are ſome very few things
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:179741:25"/> quick upon the Senſe, that are alſo full of power, as light, fire, a flaſh of lightning; and we uſe by theſe to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs ſpiritual Beings, becauſe they are of greateſt ſeparation from dull Body, and ordinary groſs matter, and too mighty for Senſe to be too free with.</p>
            <p>But let us conſider, how worthy theſe Inviſible things are of our thoughts, by this plain inſtance:</p>
            <p>If any of thoſe Beings ſhould make an appearance to us, as to ſome of old, that we read of in the Scripture, and in a retirement, what affrightment would it be to us? how unable were any ſort of men to bear ſuch an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach? and yet the force of their Beings is not in their appearance, but in the Eſſence it ſelf; for the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance they take upon them, and throw off again at pleaſure, and they only condeſcend to Senſe by theſe appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, that are therefore no part of their ſtrength; that lies treaſured up wholly in their Eſſences, ſo that their being ſeen adds nothing to them, but as we dwell in Body, they are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented more plainly to us, and ſo ſeem more potent, and dreadful alſo to us.</p>
            <pb n="36" facs="tcp:179741:26"/>
            <p>Now when we are to dye, we are to enter into the <hi>whole world of theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible Beings,</hi> and how ſhall we be able to bear ſo great a preſence, if we do not prepare our ſelves for the encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?</p>
            <p>It is true we ſhall be fitted the more to endure ſuch a ſtate thus far, that we ſhall be uncloathed of fleſh and blood, in which we are ſo amazed with any thing of the other world; but then it is further to be conſidered, if we are not reconciled to that Supreme Being, whom though (as the Apoſtle hath aſſured us) <hi>No man hath ſeen, or can ſee;</hi> yet becauſe of that, his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure is ſo much the ſwifter, and the more penetrating, and we but the more fitted to ſuffer under it, by our being diſ-incumbred from preſent groſs matter; and the horrible dread of that whole world will riſe up againſt us with more immediate impreſſion.</p>
            <p>But to him that is reconciled to God by Jeſus Chriſt, all things in Heaven are reconciled alſo, and he paſſes through thoſe Hoſts, as a man that paſſes through the moſt terrible Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, under the protection of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, or as a ſtranger through foreign
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:179741:26"/> Countries, with the eſpecial gracious Convoy of the Prince, nay higher than thus, as a particular Favourite, and Friend of the Prince.</p>
            <p>Now there is an Order of theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible Beings moſt bleſſed: <hi>God the happy, and only Potentate, Jeſus Chriſt, God over all bleſſed for ever, the Angels of Glory, the bleſſed Saints.</hi> There is higheſt and trueſt bleſſedneſs moſt certainly to be found among them, nor are they the leſs, but the more happy, for being inviſible, nor is their happineſs therefore fantaſtick, aiery, or not ſolid, becauſe not ſeen.</p>
            <p>For ſo fine, and pure, as not to be ſeen, and yet to be, gives the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt preſumption of the vividneſs and power of any thing, that can be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of it: the quickeſt motions are too quick for ſight, and the life of diſcourſe is not that which the ear hears, differing nothing from common ſound, but that which the mind per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Beings inviſible</hi> do not know one another leſs than men in Bodies, but the moſt quick communications paſs between them. Inviſibility is but a juſt diſtance from Senſe, as greatneſs
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:179741:27"/> retires and reſerves it ſelf from vulgar eyes, and every days ſight, that it may be more adored at ſolemn times of appearance; Chriſt aſcending up into his glory, a Cloud received him out of their ſight, but as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of him, ſo we may ſay of the whole ſtate of <hi>Inviſible Things; That</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 16.</note> 
               <hi>in his time he will ſhew him and them who is the only bleſſed Potentate,</hi> he will <hi>ſhew</hi> them in ſuch repreſentations as are proper to them, ſome fully poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing the mind, ſome filling the very Senſe, as it ſhall be heightened and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted by the Reſurrection, of which the glorious Body of Chriſt ſhall be the ſupreme Object.</p>
            <p>How earneſt then ſhould we be in ſeeking a communion in this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs? in <hi>laying hold upon this eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life? in ſeeking honour, glory, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality,</hi> while we are in the world? not in the leaſt diſſwaded, that they are not ſeen, but looking the more earneſtly upon them by faith, becauſe they are not like the things that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Senſe every day blows upon; and are therefore continually periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: for being ſo dull and groſs as to be ſeen, they are alſo of a compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

               <hi>things that are ſeen, but upon the things that are not ſeen; for the things which are ſeen, are but for a moment, but the things which are not ſeen, are eternal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as there is a bleſſed and happy order of <hi>inviſible Beings,</hi> ſo there is an Order of <hi>Beings inviſible,</hi> moſt wretched and miſerable; the <hi>Devil,</hi> and his <hi>Angels,</hi> and wicked men damned to their <hi>fellowſhip.</hi> How black is this ſtate? How dreadful is the wrath and miſery of their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? It is like the ſtroke of light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, ſooner felt than ſeen, and the deſtruction that is the effect of it, greater, deeper, more ſudden and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, and leaving more dread behind it, than thoſe things that work by the light and leiſure of ſenſes cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance and obſervation.</p>
            <p>If any ſhould think there wants evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of theſe things, let him think alſo, it may not be the want of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, but the want of our ſuitedneſs
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:179741:28"/> to them: It is becauſe the Soul is ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up of Senſe, that any man wants evidence; and we are angry, that we cannot by Senſe comprehend things, that are not related to it, but are nearly allyed to underſtanding, to Faith.</p>
            <p>Many things give full ſatisfaction of themſelves to learned men, yet can offer none to men unlearned; ſo do theſe objects diſplay themſelves with great clearneſs to men of purified minds, that cannot make themſelves known to Souls plunged down into Senſe, and the thick matter. The beſt expedient for the cure of ſuch men, is firſt to believe the aſſertions of men of refined minds, inviting o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to what themſelves have found, and then to receive the aſſurance, that will ariſe from their own compliance with, and experience of divine things.</p>
            <p>But further, we want moſt the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency of what we believe, rather than meerly belief: we may be more ſtrongly perſwaded of this inviſible world, than we know our ſelves to be; yet by reaſon of the great unapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the fleſhly ſtate, in regard of mind adhering ſo to it, the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:179741:28"/> hath not the force anſwerable to the belief, becauſe it is ſuppreſſed, and the want of force in the belief leſſens our feeling of the belief, which we indeed have, and muſt have, the principle of it being united with our very Souls.</p>
            <p>Having now aſſerted that there is an order of inviſible Beings, and that the Soul is ſuch a one, I come in the next place to call them <hi>Spirits,</hi> and ſo to treat of the Soul as a <hi>Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There need be no contention about the word, <hi>Spirit,</hi> it being but a word or name choſen to expreſs the notion men have in all times had of theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible and immaterial Beings, which they have made eaſie to themſelves, and others, by whatever among ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble natures is moſt ſubtile and fine, and had leaſt of the courſneſs and thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of matter, as Breath, Wind, Air. This way of expreſſing theſe Beings hath been common to Language in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and particularly to Scripture, which attributes to God, that he is a Spirit, and to Angels and the Souls of men under him.</p>
            <p>And yet it may without injury to the cauſe be granted, that this name may
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:179741:29"/> not have been original to theſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but derived from thoſe things that have been more removed from Senſe, than others, and from thence transferred to the moſt excellent part of the Temperament, or whatever is moſt vigorous in any Being, and yet leaſt under the cogniſance of Senſe, and ſo at laſt aſcribed to Beings, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be wholly removed from Senſe; and all this doth but ſtill en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten the main notion of a Spirit; for hereby it was intended to repreſent them in their native purity, and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from Body, by thoſe things that had leaſt of the dreggineſs of matter, and yet were well known; ſo comprehending at once both their ſpirituality and reality; their ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, expreſſing them by things moſt refined; their reality, in that thoſe things, how fine ſoever, were yet ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently known to be, and to be of greateſt reality and effect.</p>
            <p>Hereunto may be reduced the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Scripture makes of the <hi>Spirit of a</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Eccl. 3. 21.</note> 
               <hi>Beaſt:</hi> Touching which, leaving to Philoſophical Diſputes the abſtruſity of its nature, (whether it be the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of material, or loweſt of ſpiritual
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:179741:29"/> natures) I only obſerve, It deſerves not the name of a Spirit, in compare with the Soul of man; in that it is moſt evident the Scripture ſpeaks no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of its likeneſs to God, power of Reaſon, moral action, or immortality; but degrades it from theſe, when it ſays, <hi>while the Spirit of a man goes upward, the Spirit of a Beaſt goes downward,</hi> (that is) as it is prepared for loweſt uſes; ſo its ſtate, motion, and laſt reſt, are altogether here below; and therefore it cannot correſpond, in what is now to be ſpoken of a Spirit: yet becauſe it extends it ſelf to actions beyond the meaſure of other materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Beings, unaccountably to Senſe, it is called a <hi>Spirit,</hi> and yields light alſo to the general notion of a Spirit, and ſhews the infinite Wiſdom, and Architecture of the Author of all created Beings, who formed theſe Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits ſo as to excel the poſſibilities of matter, (ſuppoſing they do excel them) ſo little, as to be diſputed with ſome appearance of Reaſon, whether they are any more than matter mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized with higheſt and moſt curious skill, (that is to ſay) the handy-work of God in matter?</p>
            <pb n="44" facs="tcp:179741:30"/>
            <p>But to return, Whatever can be ſpoken in relation only to the word, Spirit, is of ſmaller moment; the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt concern is, what is intended by it? Whether it be no more, than a meer mode, notion, or manner of ſpeaking uſed to expreſs the lively Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, vigour, or force of a Body on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly?

               <hi>Soul,</hi> we muſt have recourſe to the Hiſtory of mans Creation, and we ſhall <note place="margin">Gen. 1. 24, 26. Gen. 2. 7.</note> find, that the wiſdom of Scripture puts a great difference between the <hi>Creation of man,</hi> and the other <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of life:</hi> in that God conſults, and reſolves to make him <hi>in his own Image and likeneſs,</hi> and by an immediate hand firſt builds a Body, as a recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle for the life he intended him, and when his Body was framed, raiſed, and contrived with all its organs, offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and miniſteries, ſo that there want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing that ſhould complete and ſum up the perfection of a Body, he breathed into his noſtrils <hi>the Breath of Life,</hi> and from that breathing of God he became <hi>a living Soul.</hi> A Soul li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that life that proceeded from himſelf, a life that proceeded from God, and entered into that prepared Body, and quickened it; whereas God only commanded the Earth, and it brought forth every other <hi>living Thing, That, and its life together.</hi> The Command of God impregnated the Earth, and then, as at once, it brought forth the living Creature, and its life; ſo that in the creation of this lower life, and the ſubjects of it, there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:179741:31"/> nothing of that method, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn order, obſerved in mans creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor did the <hi>Breath of God</hi> paſs into them, as it did into man, when it filled all the ſeveral organs and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Humane Body, with the motions proper to a Body, and ſuch a Body; and which is far beyond all this, The ſame <hi>Breath of God</hi> gives man Reaſon and underſtanding, as we have already expounded this Breath out of <hi>Elihu</hi>'s words, and as he ſpeaks in another place; <hi>The Spirit of God made him, and the Breath of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty gave him life.</hi> This inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Almighty comprehends this lower life in man, that ſenſitive Beings live, and that yet higher life of Religion, and obedience to the Creator, with which Body hath leaſt to do.</p>
            <p>For in the very Creation God put <hi>Wiſdom into the inward parts, and gave underſtanding to the heart;</hi> and by the word of Creation he ſaid to man, <hi>The fear of the Lord that is wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and to depart from evil that is underſtanding.</hi> That is, As God crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all things by ſaying <hi>Let it Be,</hi> and pronouncing it <hi>good,</hi> in confirmation
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:179741:31"/> of his Creation; ſo he ſaid to man, by implanting it in his heart, and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it for <hi>very good, The fear of the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Job 28. 28</note> 
               <hi>Lord that is wiſdom, and to depart from evil that is underſtanding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As in the univerſal Creation, <hi>he ſaw and declared, he prepared and ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out wiſdom;</hi> that is, he found out <note place="margin">v. 27.</note> within his own underſtanding, fit na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures for all things. This was his <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring and ſearching out wiſdom,</hi> and then he gave the proper natures he had deſigned, that was his <hi>declaring wiſdom;</hi> thus at the ſame time he both made up the beauty of the Univerſe, and proclaimed his own infinite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</p>
            <p>And ſo particularly in the frame of man, he was infinitely wiſe, forming man into the propriety of ſuch a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as man ſhould be, that is a Soul, whoſe perfection it ſhould be <hi>to fear God, and to depart from evil,</hi> that was made with a power to do ſo upon Reaſon, and Counſel, in which at once the wiſdom of God the original wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the wiſdom of man the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivative wiſdom to be always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to that exemplar ſhine forth together, the created in ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:179741:32"/> to the increated. Of all which Body is altogether inſenſible and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly incapable. In the original there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of man, there is according to Scripture a clear diſtinction betwixt Spirit and Body.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Scripture doth plainly own the diſtinction of the Soul from the Body, in a ſtate of conjunction with it, I argue eſpecially from the powers of mind, and the actions of thoſe powers, wherein are laid, and to which are directed continually all the Diſcourſes, and thoſe preſſing Reaſonings, Exhortations, Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Reproofs, we find in ſacred Writings. Theſe powers according to the univerſal ſpeech of mankind, it calls <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, Faculty of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Conſcience, Judgment;</hi> and the actions proceeding from theſe it names Thought, Apprehenſion, or Percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, Conſideration, Reaſoning, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation, and <hi>Apologie</hi> or <hi>Defence of Conſcience. Judging of Things,</hi> and all theſe powers working out into theſe acts, it comprehends in this word, <hi>the Spirit of man,</hi> and unites theſe acts with it, ſpeaking of theſe powers, as the Eſſence of a man, and of the acts,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:179741:32"/> as moſt connatural to that Eſſence, to which alſo every mans knowledge and feeling within himſelf give as clear teſtimony, and as full as the parts of Body give of themſelves to Senſe, <hi>For the Spirit of a man knows the things of a man within him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now it is plain; All theſe things are moſt improper to Body, or ſo much as a brutal Spirit, eſpecially, when they lift up themſelves to the ſenſe of a God, and extend themſelves to religious concernments, when they receive thoſe high propoſals of the Goſpel, and Myſteries, that lye out of the whole region of Senſe; ſo that though the organs and inſtruments of the body are ſometimes ſpoken of, and to, in theſe caſes, yet it is only upon this account, becauſe they are ſuch, as by which the mind acts, or are ſymbols and repreſentations of this rational ſenſe and motion.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being then ſo well known, and every where met with in inſpired Writings, they are as great a demonſtration of their <hi>conſciouſneſs</hi> to another greater and more excellent Being in man than Body, as can be required, ſeeing Body hath no fitneſs
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:179741:33"/> nor poſſible ſublimation to theſe things, that Scripture ſo wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts upon in relation to man.</p>
            <p>There muſt be therefore another man, a more excellent man within, or elſe all thus ſpoken muſt have been in vain; ſuch powers and actions cannot be aſcribed originally to the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent temper of Body, or Tune of motions, but muſt have a proper and peculiar ſubſtance to reſide in, and that, whatever any one elſe will call it, is that, Scripture and common ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing calls <hi>Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this being ſo plain and clear, and of ſo general conſent, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture without any induſtry, as in a caſe preſumed, ſpeaks of Spirit as one thing, and Body as another, diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes <note place="margin">1 Theſſ. 5. 23.</note> man into <hi>Body, Soul,</hi> and <hi>Spirit. Body</hi> is well enough known, <hi>Soul</hi> is either <hi>Spirit,</hi> as it contains within it ſelf the faculties of ſenſitive nature, and takes the Government of them upon it ſelf, and the care and feeling of things that concern Body, and the life of it; or as it moves in the moſt excellent parts of Body, that mediate betwixt body and mind, and are fitteſt for the more immediate motions of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:179741:33"/> Spirit in Body, and ſo called <hi>Spirits. Spirit</hi> is pure mind, exalted to its own objects, and the higheſt of thoſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, Divine Things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This Spirit</hi> is that <hi>Inward Man,</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 16.</note> Writing ſpeaks of, <hi>renewed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired every day,</hi> not in its ſubſtantial nature, but in gracious and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly qualities, of which it is the only reſidence and receipt, and which are its true health and ſtrength.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, In this diſtinction of <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body,</hi> is founded that excellent diſcourſe of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. of <hi>Being in the fleſh,</hi> and <hi>in the Spirit,</hi> of being <hi>carnally minded,</hi> or of <hi>the carnal mind,</hi> and of being <hi>ſpiritually minded,</hi> or of the <hi>ſpiritual mind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By which on one ſide he deſcribes this mind allured, and drawn down to Body and Fleſh, which comes to paſs firſt through nearneſs to Body, and cloſeſt ſympathy with all thoſe natural and ſenſitive motions, which it ſelf inſpires Body with, but chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by degeneracy, the Soul comes to feel it ſelf, and places its enjoyments wholly in fleſh, and makes that the Center of its reigning paſſions and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:179741:34"/> affections, and ſo it ſelf becomes carnal and ſenſual, and <hi>cannot pleaſe God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the other ſide is deſcribed Mind lifted up above Body, and out of Fleſh by Grace and the Divine Spirit, to an inſeparable adherence to God and Chriſt, and eternal things; to which it advances its own motions in Body alſo, <hi>preſenting them a living and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable Sacrifice;</hi> which is the <hi>ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſervice</hi> of a man, conſiſting of Soul and Body: Thus the Fleſh and the Heart together cry out for the living God; In the mean time this Spirit of the mind ſubdues and reſtrains its own motions, ariſing from unholy Bodily inclination and affection.</p>
            <p>Now to be <hi>carnally minded is death,</hi> The mind unpurged and glued to Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, dyes in that ſenſe a Spirit can dye, that is, a death of ſeparation from God, and deprivation of Divine Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Happineſs; and the Body, whoſe miniſtery it uſes, and makes it the ſeat of its carnal pleaſures and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſualities, periſhes alſo, leaving no poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſatisfaction any longer from them; and yet that Body, becauſe it was the Body of that <hi>unpurged Soul,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:179741:34"/> its order to it, remains guilty and foul duſt, and riſes again ſo, that the Soul may ſuffer, and its miſery may be ſeen in a Body, even as it ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Body, which is the ſecond death.</p>
            <p>But to be <hi>ſpiritually minded is life and peace:</hi> For Mind renewed, and made the habitation of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and its righteouſneſs, cannot it ſelf dye, no not as Spirits dye, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of that bleſſed and immortal al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyance, for it lives in the enjoyment of God, likeneſs to him, lively moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of it ſelf in all goodneſs and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs.</p>
            <p>And though the Body is dead, that is, is under the ſentence of death, to be unavoidably fulfilled in the ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Soul from the Body, upon which the Body becomes a dead lump; and further it muſt dye, that the Soul may obtain a perfect purification from ſin, which it cannot have while ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with Body, ſin being ſo lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that Cement, that there can be no perfect purification, till that Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be diſſolved; Then when that Cement is diſſolved, the ſeparated Soul becomes <hi>perfect Spirit</hi> and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,</hi>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:179741:35"/> through the almighty efficacy of the Divine Spirit reſiant in it, and bearing it up to the perfection of the <hi>Divine life for ever.</hi> Thus the Spirit is <hi>life, becauſe of righteouſneſs. And if the Spirit of him that raiſed up Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus from the dead dwell in you, he that raiſed up Jeſus from the dead ſhall alſo quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.</hi> That is, The Body, that was the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the <hi>Spirit, or Soul renewed,</hi> and purged from ſin, (that Spirit or Soul being it ſelf the habitation of the Divine Spirit) this Body, becauſe it hath ſtill a relation to ſuch a Soul loſes its ſinful taint, while it moulders into duſt, and is raiſed a <hi>Body incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> that is, <hi>a habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation fit for the Spirit now made perfect,</hi> and is filled thereby with the glory of life and immortality, which is <hi>eternal life,</hi> and all by virtue of that <hi>Divine Spirit,</hi> that dwelt <hi>in that Soul,</hi> while it was lodged and dwelt <hi>in that Body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And herein lying the true ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial ſenſe of this moſt weighty Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph of the Apoſtle, how plainly doth it expreſs the diſtinction of the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:179741:35"/> Soul from the Body, and that the Soul is a ſubſtance of it ſelf, independent upon Body, and Body altogether de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent upon it, even while it is moſt immers'd into Body?</p>
            <p>For firſt, The Soul it ſelf gives all the life to its own impure pleaſures, and ſinful repoſes in bodily delights, to which elſe Body is able to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute no more, than Oyl to the Flame, which of it ſelf we know always lyes ſtill and dark.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Spirit it ſelf aſſiſted by Grace, retires into ſpiritual enjoyments, and quenches and dryes up its own ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al affections to Body, and blaſts the ſatisfactions received from thence, even before that Oyl be waſted by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cays of Body, or dryed up by death.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, It ſelf carries its own fate, (if I may ſo call it) and the fate of the Body along with it into eternity; for according to what the Soul it ſelf is, ſo is its own happineſs or miſery, and the Body of neceſſity follows its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; ſo that it ſelf is plainly <hi>All,</hi> and the Body only a Cypher attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtate of this principal Figure.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The diſtinction of <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Body</hi> in death is conveyed to us in
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:179741:36"/> very plain and eaſie terms, and ſuch as carry their meaning very open, if not diſturbed and prevented by ill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation: Let us take a view of the clearneſs of Scripture herein.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Solomon in his Eccleſiaſtes</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving conſidered with ſome paſſion and vehemency, the little or no apparent preheminence of men above Beaſts in their death, that as one dies ſo dies the other, they ſend out one common vital breath, and go all to one place, he then caſts the account of this into the <hi>common heap of vanity,</hi> and comes to a very warm enquiry, <hi>Who knoweth</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Eccl. 3. 21.</note> 
               <hi>the Spirit of a man that goes upward, and the Spirit of a Beaſt that goes downward?</hi> Yet thereby reſolving the main caſe enough, <hi>viz.</hi> that theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearances laid ſo much to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage, are but only in the Body and outſide, the difference between the Spirit of a man and the Spirit of a Beaſt is ſtill very great, as great as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Heaven and Earth, and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as contrary, when they dye, as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and downward; but ſtill he complains, that this is not poſſible to be ſeen by Senſe, and there are very few that reach it to any purpoſe by
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:179741:36"/> Reaſon and Religion; and this (ſaith he) is one of the great points of the vanity of all worldly condition, that both ſo great a principle of Truth, and ſo great a dignity of Humane Nature, ſhould lye ſo far off, be ſo indiſcerna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: Here is then an equality in the outſide or Bodies of men a dying and Beaſts, but a great inequality or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of men above Beaſts, which comes home to what we are aſſerting.</p>
            <p>And thus <hi>Solomon</hi> underſtood of the Spirit of a man, as is now explained, he makes us more certain, when after his travel over all things, he comes to deſcribe man in his end, and does it thus, <hi>The Dust returning to the Earth</hi>

            <p>For ſuch words are not words of meer reſignation of life back again to the <hi>Fountain of Life,</hi> but an entruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and dependent recommendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and not of a life to be ſecured only for the Reſurrection, but of a Spirit immediately going to God; for elſe they might, with as much care, have committed Body to him, <hi>who weighs the duſt of the Earth in a Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance,</hi> much more that of the Bodies of men, whom he will raiſe again,

Or, why ſhould death be preferred for the ſake of a nearer and more immediate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with Chriſt, if all the man dye with the body?

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:179741:38"/> Or laſtly, why doth our <hi>Saviour</hi> am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifie the dread of the vengeance of God upon man, above theirs <hi>that kill the body, and have no more that they can do, whereas the hand of God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Luc. 12. 4, 5.</note> 
               <hi>both body and ſoul in Hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For let it be expounded to the greateſt advantage of the opinion, that encounters the Souls immortality, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>our Saviour</hi> intends no more, than that mans <hi>killing the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> is infinitely leſs, than Gods <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying that Body and its whole life in Hell,</hi> though after many Ages: Yet it is obſervable in the firſt place, <hi>our Saviour</hi> to imprint the fear of Divine Revenges, places them not only upon the Body, but upon the Soul, as a diſtinct and greater part of man than body.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And beyond this <hi>our Saviour</hi> plainly aims at the great odds there is, betwixt a hand that can execute no further than dying once, and in the body only, and that almighty hand that ſends down the Soul to Hell im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, and the Body at the Day of Judgment. For he implies, a man eaſily ſlips from mans ſeverity by death, for he may yet live and be happy in
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:179741:38"/> his Soul preſently, and in his Body at the Reſurrection; but death can give no eſcape from the ſtroke of God, either to the Soul, which incontinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly falls under it, nor to the Body awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened hereafter to endure it.</p>
            <p>Now I know it is poſſible for <hi>Serpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine wits to glide off</hi> from theſe, and many the like proofs of Scripture, that might be produced, for their way of eluſion is very wonderful, like that of <hi>Solomons Serpent upon a Rock,</hi> that winding every way, yet leaves no track of ſolid Reaſon behind it; but yet I affirm, that ſuch concurrent Teſtimonies of Scripture are ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive, that no ſober conſideration can eſcape from them; unto which <hi>revealed Truth</hi> is alſo to be annexed <hi>Reaſon it ſelf,</hi> teaching us, as I have already urged, the effects of a Soul are too great to be aſcribed to any power of Body, and therefore, ſeeing every Effect muſt have an equal Cauſe, it is a high juſtification of the aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Spirit, to which thoſe effects may be duly and worthily aſcribed.</p>
            <p>And therefore I ſhall further adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to avouch from Scripture, that <hi>the Soul</hi> is ſo much the <hi>Man,</hi> that it
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:179741:39"/> hath the compleat ſubſtantial eſſence of a man ſo far in it ſelf, that in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of it, the body is but prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for <hi>a ſenſible mode</hi> or <hi>repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> in which the Soul is to act, and ſhew, and illuſtrate it ſelf, viſibly and ſenſibly, and that man might thereby become of the order of the <hi>ſenſible and viſible world,</hi> beholding and judging by the miniſtery of ſenſitive organs, of the beauty, excellent ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray and variety of bodies in this Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and himſelf appear the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal of them; but retaining ſtill a higher and nearer relation to the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible world,</hi> to God, to the ſtate and life of Angels, ſo that without any prejudice to his main being, he may be removed out of the body thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and yet ſtill be himſelf, as to all the chief intents and purpoſes of his Creation, and continue ſo, till in the reſtitution of all things, and the manifeſtation either of the goodneſs or ſeverity of God, after the manner of the ſenſible and viſible Creation, that is, in ſuch a plain way, as ſeeing and knowing things by ſenſe, men be again ſet out by God in a bodily ſcheme or faſhion at the Reſurrection,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:179741:39"/> ſo that the Body it ſhall then have, ſhall more compliably wait upon all the ſtate and motions of the Souls happineſs or miſery.</p>
            <p>The Soul then only viſibly ſhews it ſelf now in a body, and is ſubmitted to be in it; but when it goes out of the body, it wants nothing through the whole time of its ſeparation, that it had here, but only the apparence of its motions in a body, nor hath any thing added to it, when it is cloathed with a body at the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but an opportunity for its glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or miſery to be ſeen ſenſibly.</p>
            <p>Even as God was excellent and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in himſelf from eternity, when there was no Creation, or any beſide himſelf, nor received he any thing, or found any addition to himſelf by the Creation, for all things that he made, received <hi>their All</hi> from him; but only he hath illuſtrated and manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf in the Creation, and the Creatures do no more than ſhew the power, wiſdom, and goodneſs of God in creating, preſerving, and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them.</p>
            <p>After the ſame manner, (ſo far as we may with reverence compare any
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:179741:40"/> of the Creatures with the infinitely excelling Creator) the Soul receives nothing from the Body, or any of the parts of it, but only ſuch organs and inſtruments which it is to inſpire, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, and rule, and thereby to ſhew its efficacy, vigour, and great endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of underſtanding and virtue, for all motions from the higheſt to the loweſt derive from the Soul.</p>
            <p>But as to the preſent caſe, That the Soul falls in love with its ſelf, as dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in body, and with its lower mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in it, and forgets its own proper and higher motions of immediate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſes with holineſs and true wiſdom, and that rule of body committed to it, according to theſe Laws; this is only its ſin, weakneſs, degeneracy, and fall, as of a created and mutable Being placed in a body.</p>
            <p>All motions and appetites, that we call in ordinary ſpeaking, motions of body, and fleſhly appetites, are not any thing that body can firſt proffer to the Soul, but thoſe that the Soul communicates firſt, by that univerſal life and motion it gives to body; and then derives from its own communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, the pleaſure that it ſelf finds from it ſelf in body.</p>
            <pb n="65" facs="tcp:179741:40"/>
            <p>Yet is not the Souls good or ill ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of Body all its holineſs or ſin; there are many acts ſo retired, that body ſhares not in their praiſe or guilt: The Soul in ſuch acts of goodneſs is like God and good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, as if it had no body, and as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned in this world, as God in his own immanent perfections and actions. On the other ſide, wicked men are in ſome wicked actions alone, as it were from the body, like Devils and damned Spirits, thoſe <hi>ſpiritual wickedneſſes</hi> the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, exerciſed in <hi>ſpiritual Impurities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to return, The Souls acting and taking care of the body is but an inferiour and under-part of its admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, and is for that higher end, that there might be an image and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God imprinted upon a body, and ſenſibly ſeen in it, by virtue of the Souls acting holily in and upon it. This is the higheſt and moſt excellent part of its Government, &amp; the pleaſure it takes in the lower, ſhould be but an imitation of the Lord taking pleaſure in his lower works, who is never the leſs ſpiritual, heavenly, and divine, for running through and governing the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:179741:41"/> whole world of matter, and rejoicing in his doings therein; but is always in the perfect purity of his own Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, and guides all things according to them. But contrary-wiſe, if the Soul makes its lower and leſs noble functions its principal and ſupreme, and inſtead of moving the body ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally and religiouſly, by it ſelf conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing ſpiritual and intellectual, it chiefly attends to, and intereſts it ſelf in its lower ſenſitive motions, and ſo becomes carnal and ſenſual; this is its great fall into ſin and miſery: yet ſtill it retains its prerogative of nature, it is ſtill the ſource and life of all moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though ſinful; for body alone can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſin, nor any way can it be guilty, but as the Souls body.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Soul</hi> then is <hi>All,</hi> Thus it is now, in the Reſurrection it will be much more ſo, when the body is ſo drawn up into the ſtate of the mind, that the mind hath no opportunity to be carnal in it and with it, becauſe it hath no longer ſuch a low body as this; for even the bodies of miſerable Spirits are in this part ſo refined, that the Soul can have none of its carnal delights in them, which it had in theſe.</p>
            <pb n="67" facs="tcp:179741:41"/>
            <p>In that ſpace of time then between death and the Reſurrection, the Soul muſt needs be no leſs compleat in it ſelf; for though it hath a fitneſs in it to animate a body, yet that is as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary to its abſolute perfection, as Gods actual Creation and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the world was to his power and wiſdom, whereby he created and governs; and although at the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection it appears in a body again, yet this is from the ordination of God to ſet a beauty upon the <hi>viſible Creation,</hi> in which he will then fully diſplay that part of his glory, in the glorious body of his Son, and Saints conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, and ſet out his juſtice and wrath viſibly alſo, in the dusky bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of thoſe that riſe to everlaſting ſhame and contempt.</p>
            <p>That the Soul thus ſeparated from the body is thus perfect, I argue from that expreſſion of <hi>our Saviour,</hi> that <hi>they which are accounted worthy to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Luc. 20. 35.</note> 
               <hi>that world, and the reſurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are like and equal to the Angels;</hi> ſo that though the Soul hath a power to act, order, and guide the motions of ſuch a body
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:179741:42"/> as it is joined to now, yet they are no way neceſſary to its true perfection; for its higheſt ſtate of perfection even in body is without the exerciſe of ſuch acts, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Reſurrection. And further, they that are equal to the Angels, have no more need of a body, than the Angels have; that is, not as to themſelves, or their own perfection; but only to ſerve the order of Divine Wiſdom, in the various diſpoſition of the Creation, a body, and a body ſuited to this free and exalted ſtate of the Soul, is given to them.</p>
            <p>Further, The perfection of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated Soul may be argued from the Apoſtles diſcourſe <hi>of the ſtate of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality,</hi> immediately entred into, as ſoon as ever the weak and cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Tabernacle of Earth is diſſolved. Through the gracious proviſion of God, the Soul is inveſted with life and immortality, and all the bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and entertainment of Heaven, as the moſt natural receptacle and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming robes of good Spirits, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which they would be naked; and Souls not ſo received, but left naked of that bleſſedneſs, are immediately ſhrowded in blackneſs and darkneſs,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:179741:42"/> helliſh blackneſs and darkneſs. For though Souls are indeed determined by the righteous judiciary appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, each ſort to their own place; yet the natures of theſe things themſelves are ſo wiſely contrived, as fairly to comply therewith: ſo that holy Souls uncloathed become Spirits Divine, heavenly, and bleſſed, but Souls unpurged as ſoon become dark, helliſh and miſerable.</p>
            <p>Now that happy Souls, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately upon leaving the body, enter into ſuch a ſtate, is very plain, in that they deſire earneſtly this ſtate; but if for want of bodies they lay aſleep, or if being nothing but body, the whole man ſhould lye ſo long in the earth, as till the Reſurrection, it were a much worſe ſtate than the preſent, for the time might be much better improved in the World, than in the Grave, and there would be no reaſon to <hi>groan</hi> for ſo long and dark an interval, inſtead of a life of Grace, converſe with God, and doing good in the world, which is the life of holy men.</p>
            <p>It may indeed be ſaid, It is ſafer eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way to be laid up in the Grave, and more quiet; and this interval is not
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:179741:43"/> felt, nor perceived in the duſt, but a thouſand years ſeem as ſhort as an hour; now this is ſo far from an anſwer, that it tends to ſubvert the great principle of a future life, for ten thouſand Ages, and an everlaſting duration beyond could as little be perceived: There can be no complaint, that ſo many Ages of duration were run out, before men, which lay out of life, came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, nor can there be any ſenſe of the want of life, where it was never had; and in like manner, there can be none by them that are quite gone out of life. But if this way of reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were good, it might be as well for good men, if there were no Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection at all, for they that are thus muffled up cannot make any appeals to God for, nor ſo much as know there is reaſon to deſire, a Reſurrection, nor reſent the want of it, and ſo would have no loſs. But if good men ſuffer loſs in this total ſuppreſſion of life, they muſt ſuffer proportionably in thoſe huge ſpaces of death, the Saints of God dying in the beginning of the world have already, and are ſtill to lye under till the end of the world.</p>
            <p>Further, This ſilence and interval
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:179741:43"/> of life is equal, (as to the caſe we are now ſpeaking of) to <hi>Not Being,</hi> and ſeems ſo to obliterate all the former ſtate, and the good or evil done in it, as to acquit and diſcharge it, as if it had never been, to thoſe whoſe acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are ſo quite broken off, and ſo perfectly forgotten by themſelves; It is therefore certainly moſt agreeable to Reaſon, as well as Scripture, there ſhould be at leaſt a continuation of that ſenſe and underſtanding we had of our actions in this world, when we are paſſed out of it, whether in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to happineſs or miſery, that all ſhould not begin anew in our acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of them, and evil men that have been ſome thouſands of years out of Being, as men, ſhould yet be forced to own thoſe things they did ſo long ago, having alſo been ſo many other things ſince, in the various ſhapes the matter of their Bodies may eaſily have been ſuppoſed to paſs into, and in which they may have deſerved better, or at leaſt been more innocent and harmleſs; and if there be nothing higher than that matter tuned to ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional motion, (as men of this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuppoſe) we may eaſily allow an
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:179741:44"/> expiation may have been made by that ſame matter for the offences com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, while it made up ſuch a man, in the innocency or better demeanour of it ſelf in ſome other ſtate into which it removed afterward; and ſo on the other ſide the matter that hath been virtuous, while it was ſuch a man, may afterwards come to be debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in its future diſguiſes, and ſo a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit of its former worthy perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances enſue; and thus body not be found by either ſort of men ſuch as they left it. So unreaſonable are theſe <hi>Hypotheſes,</hi> that are ſet up againſt the Souls immortality. Nor would it eaſily be believed, that there ſhould be a ſegregating care of God, to keep every mans body diſtinct, ſo as never to ſerve any other purpoſe in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Creation, it being againſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent experience; though we do not at all doubt of his calling home ſo much of that matter to unite with the Soul at laſt, wherever it may have wandred, as is neceſſary to the verity of the Doctrine of the Reſurrection, it being united to a Soul always di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, and able to give a diſtinctneſs to the matter to which it is reunited.
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:179741:44"/> But indeed upon the whole matter, I conclude it of greateſt probability, that the Scripture doth moſt often in its diſcourſes of immortality and the Reſurrection, intend the whole ſtate of eternity or future life, from the Souls firſt leaving the body, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into an everlaſting condition, throughout the endleſs Ages of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, without preciſe diſtinctions of the periods before and after the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the body, there being only a circumſtantial difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Soul in a body or out of it. Yet this ſtate is generally expreſſed by the Reſurrection, both becauſe that gives greateſt aſſurance to Spirits in bodies, and ſeems to them the moſt bulky, ſolid, and intelligible ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence; and alſo becauſe the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is the conſummation of all things in relation to Gods righteous Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the world, and judgment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, and the illuſtration or manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation thereof, in that way his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom hath thought moſt meet, that is, in a viſible, ſenſible way with reſpect to mankind.</p>
            <p>Including then, and confeſſing this Article of the Reſurrection of the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:179741:45"/> Body, as moſt true and certain; I ſay the Scripture doth by the Reſurrection expreſs the whole ſtate of an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condition, whether out of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy before the Reſurrection, or in the body after the Reſurrection, yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways fixed primarily in the Soul. For except the Reſurrection be thus under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, there could be no reaſon to them, that acknowledge a Soul, why the very foundations of Religion ſhould be reſted ſo much upon this principle of the Reſurrection; for they might be well ſecured by the firm be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and full acknowledgment of a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſtate, of happineſs or miſery, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or puniſhment in the Soul, a compleat Being without the body, as in the Soul made apparent by a body. But if we thus expound the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, of the whole future ſtate, and that this future ſtate for the former reaſons is expreſſed moſt of all by the notion of Riſing again with the body, there is both a reaſon why all Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is reſted upon it, becauſe the whole life to come is intended by it, and alſo why riſing again in the body is the fitteſt expreſſion of that ſtate, becauſe by us as in bodies the future ſtate is beſt underſtood ſo.</p>
            <pb n="75" facs="tcp:179741:45"/>
            <p>For this ſeparated ſtate of the Soul is <hi>that Hades, that ſtate of inviſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> in which according to the Rules we go by, and the apprehenſions of things we have in this world, men ſeem to be loſt, and we account them ſo in the ſtate of the dead, as to be wholly removed from the notions we as men of this world have of life, though even then <hi>they live to God,</hi> to whoſe eye the viſibility and inviſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Creatures is all alike, and he calleth thoſe that are inviſible to us as viſible, and is their God, even as he is of thoſe moſt viſible to us; his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them is as ſtrict, his care and proviſion equal, or rather ſuperior; <hi>He is not aſhamed to be called their</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 16.</note> 
               <hi>God, for he hath provided them a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> and that they are inviſible to us, leſſens them not at all to him, they ſtand as fair in his <hi>Regiſter of Beings, in his Book of life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Out of this <hi>Hades</hi> therefore Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe, the <hi>firſt begotten from the dead,</hi> and aſcended indeed into a glory out of ſight, but yet he left thereby ſuch an argument of a future ſtate, as we are moſt able to accept. And this very ſame <hi>Hades</hi> or <hi>ſtate of inviſibility</hi> ſhall
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:179741:46"/> give up all that are now in it, into the moſt <hi>viſible repreſentations</hi> of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs or miſery.</p>
            <p>Having now ſettled the diſtinction betwixt <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> I come to give ſuch deſcriptions of <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual nature,</hi> as may make further diſcovery of mans Soul, and for a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral deſcription of Spirit, I would chuſe to expreſs it in this manner:</p>
            <p>Spirit is the moſt perfect kind of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that hath none of the diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages and incumbrances of body, but hath all the force and advantage that can poſſibly be ſuppoſed in body, or aſcribed to it, much tranſcended in it ſelf; the reality and ſubſtance body ſeems to us to have, Spirit hath much more; the motion or force body hath impreſſed upon it, is much higher and more excellent in Spirit, as much more excellent as ſelf motion exceeds mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion meerly imprinted; the Senſe Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſeems to challenge is a thouſand times quicker in Spirit, and of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture unexpreſſibly higher, more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, and ſurpaſſing; and ſo through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out; all priviledge of Being is much more, and more exalted in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
            <pb n="77" facs="tcp:179741:46"/>
            <p>But more particularly, we may deem of Spirit by theſe Characters of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Spirit is purely and perfectly what it is without any mixture or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, without any incumbrance of leſs noble parts; it is wholly and perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it ſelf; That expreſſion of God concerning himſelf, <hi>I am what I am,</hi> may in a degree be accommodated to every Spirit, <hi>It is what it is.</hi> Thus the Soul of man, an inferiour Spirit, is in the <hi>Image of God</hi> the <hi>Supreme Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> The Body is ſeveral things, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral humours, and parts amaſſed, and diſtributed into ſome order, diſtant in ſituation, different in their allay, ſome more excellent, ſome baſer. But Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is <hi>All one, one All, All of an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, All one Thing;</hi> this may be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid of the Soul, though not in that high ſenſe, as of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is a Being that cannot be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided or ſeparated. It is like a beam of the Sun; who can cut off a beam in the midſt? It flyes back and recoils into it ſelf; ſo does the Soul, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of a man: You can take nothing off from it, for what can you take but it ſelf, ſeeing it is <hi>All ſelf?</hi> It is like virtue, like light, nothing can be
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:179741:47"/> pared off from virtue or light. All is one and the ſame, the very nature of theſe things forbids preciſion; the Soul goes all together, and never loſes or leaves any thing of it ſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is a Being of perfect commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and communication with it ſelf, like a Diamond cut to greateſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, you ſee it at one glance, at one eye, the whole runs as it were into every point; thus the Spirit of a man ſhines every way into it ſelf, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds upon it ſelf: The more fine, pure, and active any thing, though in bodily nature, is, the more it recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates with it ſelf, and runs, as it were, every part into every part of it ſelf, as Light, Fire, Air, which therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble Spirits, whoſe property it is more perfectly to do this.</p>
            <p>Now that theſe are true Characters of a Spirit, beſides that we have ſome kind of intuitive knowledge, or down-right look into theſe things, by the very virtue of a Spirits knowledge of it ſelf, and that general ſenſe and experience we have of our own Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and the motions and activities of them, it may yet farther be aſſured by
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:179741:47"/> what we find and perceive daily to be the diſadvantages of bodies, for we find by effects (as hath already been inſiſted upon) that there muſt be a higher order of Beings, than body, which we call <hi>Spirits,</hi> and that of this order the Supreme Being is the firſt, and that inferiour natures are ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are made in his <hi>Image and likeneſs;</hi> we muſt then aſcribe to the Supreme Spirit ſuch eſſential Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes and Characters, wherein he is infinite, as may anſwer thoſe effects, for which we ſeek ſo great a Cauſe; and ſo in created Spirits, ſeeing there are depreſſions and inconveniences, that peculiarly belong to body, by reaſon of which we cannot allow to them ſuch and ſuch effects, that are plainly above them, we muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fix ſuch Characters upon theſe ſpiritual Natures, which we ſay are created in <hi>Divine likeneſs,</hi> as may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble them above thoſe inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which befall mean matter.</p>
            <p>As when firſt we aſcribe to Spirit ſimplicity, It is eaſie to argue, that the more any thing is ſimple, ſincere, and one with it ſelf, with the more certainty it doth hold its own ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:179741:48"/> in that it can run no hazard, but of its entire ſingle eſſence, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as compounded Beings are in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual danger of a diſſolution; and the more one and ſingle any thing is, with the more force and power it proceeds to its effects, ſeeing it moves at once with its whole ſelf, and a perfect uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of its ſtrength: whereas alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded Beings muſt be accountable for their parts, which muſt be made good, that there may be a full force for the effect; but parts being but looſly ſet together, if any be loſt, the whole is impaired, and weakened according to the nobleneſs and value of the part it hath loſt: Laſtly, that ſelf-communion and communication, whereby any Being hath its center eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where in it ſelf, and hath in every point of it ſelf, the center of its own Intelligence of it ſelf, is vaſtly neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that any efficient may work with counſel and deſign, and the full im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of it ſelf to every thing it would bring to paſs; ſo that theſe things are hereby manifeſted, to be true Characters of ſuch a Being, as we call Spirit, infinite in the infinite Spirit; in created Spirits ſutable and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:179741:48"/> proportionable to the rank of their Creation, and ſo in the Soul of man, (though under the reſtraint and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages of a Body joined with it) in which we are particularly to take notice of the great force and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of theſe Characters.</p>
            <p n="1">1. From hence it follows, The Soul is a moſt active Being, of greateſt life, vigour, and motion, in a perpetual intellectual ſelf-motion, like the Sun that is always playing its beams and light; God hath prepared the Soul for ſuch a motion; in its very creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he deſigned it for motion, and ſet it into motion, a rational motion of underſtanding, will, affection, imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and remembrance, ſelf-reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and conſcience. In theſe it hath a moſt lively agitation of it ſelf, as ſoon as ever it was in being, from the very firſt moments of its being, and in the very nature of its being, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a perpetual motion, a ſelf-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or mover of it ſelf; we may perceive it in the quick and free mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Thought, the continual moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Thought, that never reſts. The purity, fineneſs, and ſimplicity of it, aſſures it cannot but be natural to it,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:179741:49"/> to move, and move it ſelf. God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed it with life and action in the very make of it; ſeeing it is all ſelf, and all of it received motion alike from the firſt mover, it can have no heavy and ſluggiſh parts to heave from their reſt, and carry along with it, by which its motion, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolled, ſhould grow dull. The moſt vivacious parts of Body, and which are moſt active, having ſo much load, ſo much dull matter, to inſpire and move on, are eaſily damped, but it is not ſo with Spirit.</p>
            <p>And then from without, Bodies continually have their motion arreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by encountring other Bodies of a contrary intention, imprinted with the juſt oppoſite motion; but Spirit finds nothing abroad to cool, but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing provokes, every thing ſtirs up their motion: For it is moved to move ſelf, by every thing that preſents it ſelf to it, and the more object the more motion; like a violent recoil from a hard body, the motion back is made fiercer. Every thing the Soul meets, inſtead of abating its motion, reflects it with a new force, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns it upon more vehement exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:179741:49"/> and enquiry; that is, more earneſt motion, if it be in things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to its knowledge; but if in things related to its affection, the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is more forcible upon it ſelf with pleaſure or vexation, according to the nature of what is encountred.</p>
            <p>Whatever is to be abated from this account of the Souls motion, muſt be imputed to the inconvenience of its working by Body, whoſe chanels are ſo tender and brittle, and cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure too great vehemency; in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion to which the motion is mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, the conduits are ſo ſtrait, and obſtructed through the Senſes unexer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed to the uſes and ends of the Soul, that its action cannot ſtream out like it ſelf: Laſtly, the inſtruments and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans grow weary and heavy, by the diſadvantages and rencounters, the parts of matter have between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; upon which the Souls motion ſeems ſlower, and tired alſo.</p>
            <p>Yet there is no time wherein Thought ſtands ſtill, though in the narroweſt Soul, and how meanly ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it be employed, as it is in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and ſordid minds. But further, there are at all times great Examples
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:179741:50"/> of the lively motions of the Soul of man, in wiſe and excellent perſons, and of the greatneſs and vehemency thereof; which is yet a thouſand fold greater, and will be perfect in the everlaſting ſtate: Its motion will be then wound up to the higheſt, and there will be no allay from a heavy Body; then all the thoughts, affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, powers, will ſally out with an unimaginable life. Oh how neceſſary is it, that we prepare by holy motion, and action now, to that motion, that it may be bleſſed, ſeeing there is no reſt from it, there is no quieting it, nor ſo much as ſlackning the ſwiftneſs of it. If it be not a motion that makes happy and bleſſed, it is yet as high a motion, but in miſery, and to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of miſery.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Hence it follows, the Soul is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal, becauſe it is perfectly it ſelf, and ſo ſeparated from all things elſe; for the alteration of things in matter is from their compoſition, one thing having many meeting to make it up, and theſe either ſtruggling and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting among themſelves, the ſtronger ſubduing the weaker, or by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibleneſs of outward impreſſion upon
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:179741:50"/> one, or more of the ingredients, a diſſolution of that compoſure is brought to paſs. The Heavens, and heavenly Bodies being purer, and more uncompounded have ſtood ſo many Ages with ſo little alteration.</p>
            <p>A Spirit being ſimply and entirely it ſelf can neither be forced aſunder by feuds within it ſelf, nor by violence from without; there being nothing in its ſubſtance to make any inteſtine War, nor any thing weaker or ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to ſubdue, or be ſubdued; and therefore it receives all ſtrokes upon its whole ſelf, as an Anvile that is beaten cloſer and more united by all the Hammers that fall upon it. All the griefs and troubles, and diſquiets that riſe up in it, are only the croſſes and counter motions, and actions of its ſentiments and apprehenſions; yea the very diſmal falls of Divine Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure upon it, do but awaken and ſtir up ſad and grievous apprehenſions in it, but do not in the leaſt touch the eſſence or ſubſtance of the Soul to weaken it.</p>
            <p>This is that death, the only death of the Soul, that it is capable of a darkneſs in the loſs of that Beauty,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:179741:51"/> and excellency of holy motion, and in the deprivation of happineſs and bleſſedneſs, the favour of God, a loſs of its perfection without any diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Being. And though it be now in the Body, and ſeems to be loſt in the ruines of that, yet it is indeed ſo perfectly it ſelf, ſo ſeparable in its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from the Body, (as I have already diſcours'd at large) ſo diſtinct and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete in it ſelf, that it is only acquitted from that in death, not at all altered or changed in its ſubſtantial ſelf.</p>
            <p>So then this ſimplicity of the Soul witneſſes the Immortality of its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that it cannot be diſſolved like the things of this world, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in the union of ſeveral things, that conſpire and meet together, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards flye aſunder; but the Soul hath nothing to loſe, or part from, but its whole ſelf, being one ſimple thing; <hi>One All,</hi> and <hi>All One,</hi> there can be no diſſolution.</p>
            <p>Nay the things of this world, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they are ſeveral things, united and made up ſo into one, as ſeveral things can be, and when thoſe ſeveral things flye aſunder, that one thing is diſſolved; yet becauſe the parts ſtill
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:179741:51"/> continue to be, they become ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe; for there can be no anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilation, or bringing things back to nothing but by the omnipotency that created them; ſo that all the death and diſſolution, that is in whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is but only a continual flux and reflux; a perpetual paſſing out of one ſhape, figure, nature, into another, which, becauſe things love to be as they are, look for the preſent like death, periſhing, and the decay of the world it ſelf; although the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, for that time being, is only brought to ruine; and although the parts, it may be, are meliorated, made more beautiful and advanced; as when a Veſſel of Silver deſigned for baſer uſe is broken to pieces, purged in the Refiners fire, and then made a Veſſel of honour, and the materials of a meaner and decayed Building taken down, and laid into a nobler Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture; yet while this is doing, it hath the appearance of ſpoil and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, whereas indeed all, even to the very Fragments, is gathered up that nothing may be loſt, not ſo much as the filth of the Veſſel, or the duſt of the Building.</p>
            <pb n="88" facs="tcp:179741:52"/>
            <p>We may then thus far derive from lower Nature, what may make the Immortality of the Soul an eaſier No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to us: For we ſee, It is the twiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things together, with ſuch une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual ſtrengths of the Parts in motion one againſt another, and the liable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thoſe Parts to the impreſſion of Forreign Motion, that let in the Mortality and Frailty that is in world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Things; that ſo by the prevalency ſometimes of one thing, ſometimes of another, there might be thoſe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Changes and Viciſſitudes, that God hath appointed for Purpoſes moſt agreeable to the greatneſs and myſteriouſneſs of his moſt wiſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Providence.</p>
            <p>But the ſimpler, and more ſelf any thing is, the more hardly it is altered, till we come to that which is call'd <hi>Firſt Matter</hi> and <hi>Motion,</hi> which in the abſtract Notion of them, and as they are by themſelves, cannot be chang'd or loſt, but by annihilation.</p>
            <p>For that we call <hi>Firſt Matter,</hi> or <hi>Matter,</hi> as we underſtand it <hi>unim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd by Form,</hi> or <hi>Particular Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> though as it is in <hi>Particular Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> it by always dying out of one
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:179741:52"/> Shape, Figure, Nature, into another; is yet ſo immortal in it ſelf, that it cannot it ſelf periſh but by annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And that Motion which is us'd by God for the twirling this Matter into ſo many ſeveral Forms, and is perpetually flitting from one part of it to another, and is even driven and expuls'd by the Contraſts it hath with it ſelf, as it is in thoſe ſeveral parts of Matter, from one to another; cannot yet be ſpent in the Sum, or any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of it be abated in the Total.</p>
            <p>Theſe two, becauſe thus abſtracted, they are perfectly and intirely them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, have thus much of Immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that they never take End, till an End is put to them by Almighty Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency: But <hi>Matter</hi> is laid by God, and ſo lies as a <hi>Foundation</hi> of his Works, that cannot be removed; and <hi>Motion</hi> is the <hi>Inſtrument</hi> he hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the management of thoſe his Works; and theſe in their ſimple ſelves have no Jars within, nor cannot be touched by any extern Hand; but as they are in compoſition, undergo thoſe ſeveral Changes, and haſten out of the poſture into another, as it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God; being ſtill the ſame in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:179741:53"/> For all that Matter can be ſqueez'd into, is Matter; and all that Motion can be overcome into, is Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and ſo they will be, till they are diſannull'd by God.</p>
            <p>And thus the Soul, its own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, its own Motion, receiving both from God in its very Being, and ſo being all Self, as an unſhaken Rock, or <hi>Firſt Matter,</hi> bears and lies under all the diſpoſes of God, and as higheſt Life turns every way with, &amp; ſubſerves his admirable Adminiſtrations upon it ſelf, which are all in Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Holineſs, Juſtice, and Mercy. This Spirit, I ſay, lies under all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Impreſſions that can be made on a Soul; and yet it is a Soul ſtill, it is always the ſame; It is always the ſame as to its Eſſence, and cannot be ſo altered or changed, as to become another Thing: It muſt be it ſelf, or it muſt be nothing; and all Action upon it, can but provoke it to Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual Action: So it is found, and ſo it is left by every thing that comes near it, except God ſhould come to make a final Determination upon its Being. There is no change upon the Subſtance of a Spirit, but Annihilati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:179741:53"/> The State, and Condition, and Quality of it may be chang'd from Good to Evil, from Evil to Good, from Happineſs to Miſery, from Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Happineſs; the very Being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains unalterable, while it is.</p>
            <p>The onely way then of the Souls coming to an end, muſt be by Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilation, or being cruſh'd to Nothing by Infinite Power: Concerning which, let us further conſider,</p>
            <p>It is true, the <hi>Eſſence</hi> and <hi>Exiſtence</hi> of the Soul are ſeveral things: that is, There is the Nature of the Soul in general, and this is one thing, and is call'd its <hi>Eſſence;</hi> and this conſidered in a poſſibility of Actual Being, or not Being, as it may be, or may not be: When it is, we call it <hi>Exiſtence,</hi> or <hi>Actual Being;</hi> and this is another thing from its <hi>Eſſence.</hi> Therefore it might either not have come into Being at all; or after it is come into Being, it may be turn'd out of Being by the immediate Power of God, who gave it Being, who onely can annihilate or bring to nothing that which is.</p>
            <p>In all theſe things the Soul is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all expreſſion excell'd by God, <hi>who onely,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>hath</hi>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:179741:54"/> 
               <hi>immortality:</hi> For he it is alone that in the trueſt ſenſe is what he is; ſo inconceivably and perfectly <hi>Himſelf,</hi> that he is onely of, and from himſelf; and <hi>Himſelf</hi> ſo infinitely, that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends and embraces in himſelf the <hi>whole Divine Nature,</hi> and there is not <hi>a ſecond God. He is alone, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides him there is no God; he knows not any other; with him there is no variation nor ſhadow of turning,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his Being, nor in any of the Attributes of his Being: <hi>Moſt Great and Good, Moſt Happy and for ever Beſt.</hi> For he hath all within himſelf, and there is nothing without him of any compare with him, not any thing, but what receives Being from him; ſo that neither from within, nor from without, can there be any occaſion of change in him: He it is, whoſe <hi>Eſſence</hi> and <hi>Exiſtence</hi> are one and the ſame Thing. His <hi>Eſſence,</hi> in the very true Notion of it, riſes up into imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate and abſolute <hi>Exiſtence:</hi> For there is no other Notion of his <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,</hi> but in his <hi>Exiſtence.</hi> It is his very <hi>Eſſence</hi> or <hi>Nature</hi> to <hi>Be.</hi> He is never ſo little, as in a poſſibility to Be; but always ſo great, that it is
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:179741:54"/> impoſſible he ſhould not Be. He is without the allay of a poſſibility to Be, which alſo includes a poſſibility not to Be. He is the higheſt and moſt perpetual <hi>Act of Being; Eternal in the very Life of Being.</hi> To grant the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God no incompoſſible Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is to wrap up a Mans ſelf in the concluſion he is, and that unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably: For he is a neceſſary Being, a Being that cannot but Be.</p>
            <p>And it is of much conſideration concerning his Being, that there ſhould be ſuch a Lock upon the Mind of Man, that it can no ſooner grant, There may be a God; but it is ſurpriz'd with this, There muſt be a God: for the very Nature of <hi>Deity</hi> concludes a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Being, <hi>Abſolute Being.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God is Paramount in theſe Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives of Being; and the Soul can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be likened to him, from whom it hath its <hi>All.</hi> But yet a much truer and nobler Immortality have the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and Souls of Men, than Matter and Motion before ſpoken of; ſeeing Spirit is deſign'd, prepar'd for, and in its own Nature, and immediately in it ſelf, of much higher Excellency, Purity, Self-motion, fit for Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:179741:55"/> and all Rational Enjoyment; as much above any Notion of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or appearance of it in any Form, or acted by any Motion, or into any Nature whatever, as Heaven is above Earth.</p>
            <p>And beyond this, It is the Nature of Spirits, having their Subſtance, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Motion, all within themſelves, to be always diſtinct, and to have Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence in themſelves, proper and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to themſelves, and divided from all others: whereas the others, as they are made up in ſuch and ſuch Natures, and out of which they are not found, are continually altering and changing, and paſſing out of one Form into another, and have no other actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Subſiſtence in themſelves, but what they have in theſe ſo continually vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated Appearances.</p>
            <p>For the whole Stock of Matter and Motion, that is in the World, is made uſe of by God in common; and theſe two are always running every way, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all the ſucceſſive Compoſitions the Creator hath deſign'd them for, and as they are govern'd by him: But all the whole Nature of Spirit, that hath ever been in the Creation, from the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:179741:55"/> very Beginning, hath without any confuſion, or running one Spirit into another, been preſerv'd in ſtricteſt diſtinction and ſeparation one from another, ſo many <hi>proper Subſiſtences,</hi> always known to God, underſtood, and taken notice of by him, in this their diſtinctneſs; and ſo are, and ſhall be known to themſelves for ever; and as ſuch, they ſhall be manifeſted and expoſed to the <hi>univerſal Aſſembly</hi> of themſelves, Angels, and Men, and judg'd according to their Works; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have been their own, and not anothers with them.</p>
            <p>So then, though the Spirits and Souls of Men, even as Matter and Motion, are dependent upon the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Creator, whether they ſhall continue in Being, or not, if we ſpeak of the thing abſolutely; yet it is very evident, from the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the whole ſtate of the matter, that Spirits are the moſt proper and natural Inhabitants of Immortality; and howſoever it may pleaſe the Creator to determine upon the other Parts of the Creation, yet there is as great aſſurance as Reaſon can riſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and higher yet from Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:179741:56"/> that he intends that our Souls ſhould be for ever; ſeeing he hath made them with Faculties, and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Action, Intellectual, Moral, and immediately reſpecting himſelf; which are ſo connatural to the true ſtate of Immortality, and ſo plain an approach to, and reſemblance of him, who on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath Immortality, that it is almoſt impoſſible to a ſerious Conſiderer to think, that there could be any other deſignation of them by God, but for an immortal duration; ſeeing he hath ſo prepared them for ſuch a Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who does nothing in vain, nor does ſo debaſe his own Image, as to draw the Lineaments of it in Duſt. It remains then, That the Soul in the Nature given it by Creation, and in the deſignation of the Almighty, who gave it that Nature, is an <hi>Immortal Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. From the Character of a <hi>Spirits ſelf-communication,</hi> it follows; The Soul is an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding:</hi> For the higheſt degree of Self-communication is Underſtanding. Even in things ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial, when any thing ſeems to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with another, and to receive Intelligence from another, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:179741:56"/> it again to it, there is a ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of underſtanding; as in the <hi>Sympathetique</hi> anſwer of one Lute to another: <hi>When the Heaven hears the Earth,</hi> in the <hi>Prophets</hi> phraſe, it ſeems to underſtand it. The mutual Returns of one Creature to another, are a kind of Underſtanding in them; or rather that Great Underſtanding of God runs through them all, and is an Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in their behalf. Life, within the compaſs and ſphere of that Being that hath it, is ſelf-communicated Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for all the Parts are in a confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy one with another, and at an agreement among themſelves, for the motion of the whole Frame, as if they had treated, and ſtill held intelligence one with another: But in Diſeaſes they grow ſtrange to one another; their <hi>Language,</hi> like that of <hi>Babel,</hi> is <hi>confounded,</hi> and in death utterly ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenc'd. But the higher the Life, ſtill the more appearance of Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, becauſe there is a higher <hi>Self-communication,</hi> till we come indeed to the Life of Underſtanding, and ſo up to the higheſt Life and higheſt Underſtanding, which is alſo the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, moſt true, and perfect <hi>Self-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,</hi>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:179741:57"/> that is, the <hi>Life and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of God,</hi> who hath not onely a Life and Underſtanding with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himſelf, but alſo of, and from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; <hi>An Eternal Self-communication,</hi> or Reflection of himſelf, to, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himſelf, upon himſelf: And this <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Spring of Being,</hi> and <hi>Self-commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,</hi> never ceaſes, nor can ceaſe to communicate himſelf to himſelf, ever knowing, underſtanding himſelf, enjoying, converſing with himſelf, which is <hi>Eternity of Life;</hi> for he that does thus, can never have been out of Being, nor can ever die: A perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Circle of deriving himſelf from himſelf, to himſelf: A pureſt Intellect and Mind, ever beholding, and moſt divinely reſenting it ſelf in uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Knowledge, and underſtanding of it ſelf, and <hi>ſo living for ever:</hi> For, what underſtands, lives; and what un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands higheſt, lives higheſt; and what <hi>underſtands for ever, lives for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All Creatures of Life, even of high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Life, the Life of Underſtanding, have in an abated ſenſe onely <hi>Life within themſelves,</hi> or a <hi>Self-communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> having receiv'd it at firſt, and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:179741:57"/> receiving it ſtill every moment from God. <hi>In Chriſt was Life as in the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Johan. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Fountain,</hi> that is, that <hi>high Life</hi> of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding;</hi> and this Life was the <hi>Light of Men,</hi> that is, the Spring and Original of their Underſtanding.</p>
            <p>And this Underſtanding, in reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of God's Life, is the proper Life of the Soul: For the Soul lives by feeling it ſelf in theſe <hi>Self-commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications,</hi> by perceiving its own Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations, Conceptions, Comprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Affections, and whatever elſe are the natural Reſults and Activities of a Rational and Intellectual Life; even as we feel and perceive Natural Life, by the ſeveral Motions and Self-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications of that Life: And this Life, if we ſpeak ſtrictly of it, as it is a Life of Reaſon and Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hath no Contrary, it hath no Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary to encounter, nor is there any Privation of it conceivable, except by the deſtruction of the Soul it ſelf into nothing.</p>
            <p>For this Life is as near to the Soul, as Luſtre and Splendor is to Light; if you take it away, the very Nature it ſelf is loſt; all the Wickedneſs and Miſery in Hell cannot quench it: For
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:179741:58"/> who more knowing, ſagacious, reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, in all Motions natural to Spirits, than the Devils? That which comes neareſt to the ſtupefying this Life, is being ſunk down into Body; in the lower ſtate of which yet this Life re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, though greatly cover'd and conceal'd; and it cannot be long ſo conceal'd. This Life is therefore, in this regard, plainly a Life immortal; except God himſelf by an immediate hand extinguiſh it; and this cannot be believ'd, ſeeing it is ſo near a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of his own Life: For, that he ſhould make an Intellectual Life, ſo high in its Nature, to ſo low a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, is not agreeable with the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of all the Works of God.</p>
            <p>Now this Underſtanding, as we have ſaid, is <hi>Self-communication:</hi> For as Reaſoning or Ratiocination is the communicating of Things one with another in a way of compare, a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating of them one with another, and ballancing them together, and then giving the account; and the quicker and more ſudden this motion is made, the more lively is the Ratiocination, and the more excellent is the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding: So the Principle of this
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:179741:58"/> Ratiocination every moment confers with it ſelf, what it hath attain'd by this courſe of Reaſon, and recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates with it ſelf all it hath obſerv'd. God in an infinite manner knows him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf within himſelf, and all that is, in a moment, by an Omnipreſent Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding: but according to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage the Soul hath to work with, as it is in the Body, or in the ſtate of ſeparation from it; ſo the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of Man goes a greater or leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer Circle, for the communicating with Things; but every moment it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates with it ſelf, what it gathers by its communication with other things. This <hi>ſelf-communication</hi> both of the <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Humane Spirit,</hi> the Apoſtle thus expreſſes to us; <hi>The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 10, 11.</note> 
               <hi>ſearches the deep</hi> or moſt retired <hi>things of God.</hi> There is nothing in God reſerv'd, or afar off from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; he eternally communicates his whole ſelf with himſelf: ſo he hath given to Man to underſtand himſelf; <hi>The things of a man knows no man, but the ſpirit of a man that is within him;</hi> and that knows them. So then a Man hath a power of <hi>ſelf-communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> or <hi>underſtanding the things</hi>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:179741:59"/> 
               <hi>within himſelf:</hi> Yet God communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates with Mans Soul nearer than he can with himſelf; that is, he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands more of Man, than Man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf does; <hi>he is greater than our</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 20. Pſal. 139. 2.</note> 
               <hi>hearts, and knows all things; he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands our thoughts afar off.</hi> The Reaſon is, He is the Fountain of this Life of Underſtanding; <hi>In him we intellectually live, and move, and have our being;</hi> and he knows <hi>in himſelf</hi> what is done in us, <hi>by the vertue that goes out of him</hi> for the doing of it: for he communicates with himſelf, all that he enables his Creatures to do.</p>
            <p>From all this then it appears, That to underſtand any thing, is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with it. The Mind commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates with all it underſtands; and the Nature of Underſtanding, is commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating with Things, and <hi>ſelf-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication.</hi> The Mind communicates with it ſelf all it receives by commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with other Things: The Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding goes out, to underſtand things at a diſtance from it; It com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates with them; It enters into their Natures, as far as it can: Yet it is not in this chiefly an Underſtanding, but that it reflects within it ſelf its
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:179741:59"/> own Obſervations, in that it commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates with it ſelf all the while, it communicates with other things, and feels within it ſelf its own Percepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as the Eye perceives its own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions. In this it is chiefly an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; not like a dead Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Trepan, that enters within things, and knows not that it does ſo; that takes hold, without any appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion: or like the Eye of a Beaſt, that looks upon things without Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and comes no nearer them, than Senſe can do. Things that cannot communicate themſelves within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, cannot underſtand. Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding encreaſes it ſelf by more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and continual <hi>Self-communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> Underſtandings encreaſe one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by mutual communication, and grow greater Underſtandings, and as it were into one common Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. This is the proper Nature, and the Specification of an Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and the Soul in its very Eſſence is an Underſtanding.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The fourth Conſequence from the Nature of a Spirit, is, That the Happineſs or Miſery of it muſt needs be exceeding great: For ſince ſuch a
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:179741:60"/> Being cannot but have great Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for one of theſe States, whichſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of them it is, it muſt needs be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great, both becauſe it feels it ſelf throughout in either of them, and muſt needs do ſo, in regard of the Reciprocation, <hi>Self-communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of all its Powers and Motions; and in regard of the Fineneſs and Purity of its Being, not abated by Groſneſs, Diſtance, and Diſtinction of Parts, but the Whole running into it ſelf: as alſo in regard of the Forcible mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Spirit, which carries there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore its Griefs or Pleaſures with the rapidneſs of its own motion, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bleſſes or torments it ſelf, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the vehemency of its Nature.</p>
            <p>The Spirit or Soul of Man in the Body diſcovers ſomewhat hereof, but in lower degrees, by reaſon of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution of it ſelf to the ſeveral Parts, Pleaſures, Pains, and various Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments of Bodily Nature; which while the Soul condeſcends to, and complies with, it ſeems to imitate; ſo that it taſtes generally intermixed Pleaſures onely, and ſuffers but alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viated Griefs, becauſe this agrees moſt with the Condition of Body, that
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:179741:60"/> hath nothing pure: And further, while it is thus intereſted, its own proper Motions and Activities are both damp'd and confin'd: For Body is dull and ſtrait; and if the Soul dwells in it, and acts by it, it muſt proportion it ſelf to it, or elſe it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be its Inſtrument.</p>
            <p>Yet theſe Properties of the Soul are not altogether imperceptible, even in Bodily ſtate; for as the Soul is conform'd very far to the Body in thoſe Regards, ſo hath the Body its Conformities to the Soul, and thoſe much more neceſſary, ſeeing it is act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and moved by it: For even Bodily Senſe pays this reſemblance to Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, that in every Part it bears Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy with what is felt in any one Part: Yet this is, becauſe the Soul en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livening the whole Body, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking for every Part, feels in it ſelf, as in the Center, the ſtate of every Part; though it feels according to the manner, nature, and ſituation of the ſeveral parts of the Body.</p>
            <p>In ſome degree of Likeneſs alſo the vigour of the Souls Reſentments are ſeen, in the moſt ſpirituous Pleaſures or acute Pains of Body, that are able
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:179741:61"/> to move Nature high, which fall out onely in a lively Conſtitution, and not taken off, ſo as to chill the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, or dull the Pain; becauſe the Soul hath more Active Bodily Powers to ſhew it ſelf by, and wherein it can give greater Teſtimony of its own vivid Motion, though but in concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs for the Body. Thus the Pains of Stone and Gout are much ſharper, becauſe they abate ſo little from the Conſtitution: and the vigours of Health are neceſſary for the receipt of Pleaſure.</p>
            <p>But the Soul is much more in things proper to it ſelf <hi>All Center,</hi> where every one of its proper Pleaſures and Pains meet; that is, Spiritual Joys and Sorrows: and then the livelineſs, perſiſtency of its Nature, carries up to a height all its Enjoyments, or Sufferings. But this is never ſo clear, as in its ſeparated and free eſtate; for then eſpecially, as it is ſaid of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, It is all drawn as it were into every Moment: So whatever can be ſuppos'd in any Point of the Intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Nature, if we could ſo diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, in the ſame inſtant runs through all; which is the firſt Height of the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:179741:61"/> Happineſs or Miſery of a Spirit.</p>
            <p>In the next place, the Happineſs or Miſery of a Spirit can be no other than a Happineſs or Miſery of a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual nature, and ſo cannot but be great; for that is the Nature of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing Spiritual: It is all what it is, and nothing elſe. Every thing but Spirit hath a great deal of cumber, a great deal of Clothes and Habiliments upon it: But Spirit is purely it ſelf; Spiritual Happineſs hath no clog up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it; Spiritual Miſery hath no Sheath upon it, it is all Edge: And when we are entred into the Region of Spirits, there will be no heavineſs of Body, nor diverſions of that in the way. The Bodies of the Reſurrection, when we receive them, will be fitted to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity and ſwiftneſs of our Minds, and prepar'd ſo wholly for them, as moſt perfectly to attend their condition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But becauſe we ſee the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy now ſuch an Obſtruction to all Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Soul, it may be doubted, whether there may not be a ſtate of Souls, as inſenſible or more inſenſible than now.</p>
            <p>To reſolve this, the Scripture tells us, God makes the Happineſs of his
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:179741:62"/> Saints like <hi>a River of higheſt Pleaſure,</hi> and the puniſhment of Evil <hi>like a ſea of flaming Brimſtone,</hi> both to the height; therefore it withal appears, the Faculties are rais'd to the height alſo: Elſe there could be no ſuch Happineſs, nor any ſuch Puniſhment. Inſenſible things enjoy nothing, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure nothing; and the lower the Senſe, the lower of neceſſity is alſo the Enjoyment, and the Pain: There muſt be therefore an exaltation of the Faculties to the higheſt Life, that in the meeting of the Object, and the Faculties, there may be greateſt Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction or Miſery.</p>
            <p>Yet it may be underſtood upon this very account, there may be Glories and Puniſhments of higher and lower degrees, according to the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or low eſtate of the Faculties; and that the ſtate of the other World may be proportion'd to this, that he, who by a Soul more enlarg'd in this World, he who <hi>by five Talents gain'd</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Luc. 19. 17, 19. Luc. 12. 47, 48.</note> 
               <hi>ten,</hi> or <hi>that knew his Maſters will,</hi> and yet did it not; theſe being agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably of higher apprehenſions, and quicker motions in this World, are in the World to come, by the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:179741:62"/> elevation of thoſe Powers, made <hi>Rulers over more Cities,</hi> or <hi>beaten with more ſtripes:</hi> but thoſe of <hi>fewer Talents,</hi> and meaner Sentiments, keep ſtill their Ranks, being <hi>Rulers over fewer Cities,</hi> or <hi>beaten with fewer ſtripes:</hi> Yet in each of theſe, the ſtate of their Souls here, and in Eternity, differs as much in regard of their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, and the clearneſs of their Faculties, as Twilight and Noon-day. From this ſtate of things that hath been given, it may be briefly inferr'd in theſe Particulars following.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If the Souls of Men, that are an Inferiour Spirit, are ſo active and high in their motion; then how exalted, and infinitely adorable are all the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of that Supreme Spirit, lifted up out of all Height! That Eternal-Fountain-Author-Spirit, how infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pure is his Being, without any va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation or ſhadow of turning; dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in ſuch a Light and Luſtre of his own Divinity, that nothing can ſo much as approach or come within any diſtance of? Although his Spirit runs through All, yet there is an infinite ſeparation of Excellency between God and all things. How clear and bright
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:179741:63"/> is his Underſtanding, before whom <hi>Hell is naked, and Deſtruction hath no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering! Darkneſs and Light are all one to him,</hi> becauſe Light and Glory are always round about him, and Hell is but the diſpleaſure of his Holineſs againſt Sin, like a Flame that dazles, and ſcorches together: <hi>A Fire devours before him, and burns up his Enemies on every ſide.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How potent are his Efficacies, which way ſoever he turns them, for Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Conſervation, or the Change of Things, as he pleaſes! What is his Favour, or Diſpleaſure, but the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Efficacies of Kindneſs, or Severity; of <hi>Joy unſpeakable and full of Glory,</hi> or <hi>of weeping and wailing,</hi> without all eaſe or remedy! How do all Spirits Good and Holy, <hi>caſt their Crowns before him,</hi> and laud him with eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Acknowledgments of both their Being and Happineſs, to his Grace and Goodneſs, and Acclamations to his Praiſe! And that Stream from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that feeds with Being and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuality thoſe ſo unhappy and wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Spirits, depoſed from their Glory and Perfection, neceſſitates them to ſurvive the Inſtances of his Juſtice and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:179741:63"/> Holineſs, to the admiration and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting wonderment of the Bleſſed, (yet with profoundeſt Reverence of unſtain'd Holineſs) and their own aſtoniſhment and horror without end.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If the Soul is a Being ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, how foul is Sin, that defiles it; like a Poyſon, that preſently darkens a Diamond, or infects the very Beams of the Sun, or ſoils the Light? We ſhould ever reſiſt Temptations to ſin, with the ſad conſideration of defiling ſo excellent and immortal a Spirit.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It ſhews how excellent the Price muſt be that redeems ſuch a Spirit. Great is the Redemption of the Soul by Chriſt, the Renovation of the Soul by the Holy Spirit.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We ſhould conſider this Spirit, that though now it is enclos'd in the Body, yet ſeeing it is prepar'd to much higher and more excellent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it muſt burſt out; it cannot be always held; it muſt have a freedom, that it may expatiate it ſelf: Elſe ſo great Powers, having ſo little Action now, muſt have been prepar'd in vain.</p>
            <p n="5">5. We ſhould meditate much upon this great Character of a Spirit: It cannot die; It is ſo it-ſelf, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:179741:64"/> die: Its very Being is Intellect, Life, and Motion; ſo that it cannot ceaſe to live, except it ceaſe to be: God, who alone hath power over it, hath deſign'd it to be for ever, and fram'd it for perpetuity, and ſo, that it can have no Adverſary of its Life or Being: It is ſo ſeparate from all things elſe, that nothing of Body can come near its Eſſence or Life. What Sword or Fire can cut off or conſume Thought, much leſs the Soul, the Original or Spring of it? What moſt ſubtle thing in Nature can deſtroy the Affection of Love or Fear, much leſs ſo attaque the Judgment or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as forcibly to ſuppreſs them? They can kill the Body; but they have no more that they can do.</p>
            <p>No created Spirit, how principal ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, can come near the Being of the loweſt orbed Soul, thus to touch it: Sathan the great Enemy of Spirits knows this ſo hopeleſs an attempt, as never once to plot it: All his intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt Humane Spirits, are one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſway them to Evil, and ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate them into Miſery; but yet they cannot be maſter'd by the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Archangel, ſo much as in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:179741:64"/> of themſelves, except they ſurrender and betray their own Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luteneſs.</p>
            <p>One Spirit may imprint Thought upon another, offer Argument, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to induce Affection; but the Soul is at its own choice for accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and whether it accept, or not, its Being is ſtill the ſame, its Power of Self-reſervation the ſame; ſo dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-guarded is the Soul in this great Privilege of being <hi>It ſelf:</hi> Guarded in its Eſſence or Life, guarded in its Liberty and Freedom; which argues it a Being of greateſt account. Now in that it muſt always live, Holineſs and Happineſs, the enjoyment, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and perfection of its Life, are with greateſt earneſtneſs, and upon greateſt neceſſity to be ſought; Sin and Miſery, ſuch a degradation of its Life, that the Scripture calls them Death, are by all means to be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and eſcaped from: And ſeeing it hath a Secret of its own Freedom, that no Spiritual Principality or Power can enter into or invade, it can onely charge its Ruine upon it ſelf: But in the Supreme Spirit, God himſelf is all its ſtrength, who perpetuates his firſt

Oh the care that is due to ſuch a Soul as this! A care due from it ſelf to it ſelf, yet miſerably negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by it ſelf, in its true ſelf, for it ſelf, as engag'd in a Body, out of which it is yet always haſting, and leaves it in death; it ſelf being in greateſt danger of a death exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worſe, though of another nature; in the bringing about of which, the malice of Hell is always buſie and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd, chuſing that as a much higher effect of its ſpite and cruelty, than Annihilation, if it had been within the Power of Devils to turn a Soul into nothing.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Laſtly, What unſpeakable Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of Happineſs or Miſery doth a ſelf-moving, a ſelf-communicating Spirit enter into, when it enters into its own place! For there it meets thoſe immenſe Objects, God, his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour or Diſpleaſure, the true appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:179741:65"/> of Sin and Holineſs, the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Aſſembly of Spirits, happy and miſerable, with their univerſal and endleſs Condition: It ſelf appearing to it ſelf in its full extent of Nature, Duration, and Relation to all theſe. Now its ſelf-motion and ſelf-commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication (which are its very Being, and therefore perfect in its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Element) are active to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt. Self-motion turns it every way, with unutterable ſwiftneſs, upon theſe Objects; and Self-communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion makes all its own, converts unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termittingly all its Obſervations upon them, into moſt beatifying or affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Reſentments, according to the Order it ſtands in to thoſe Objects of Happineſs or Miſery.</p>
            <p>Two principal Accounts of the Soul of Man are now diſpatch'd; the firſt, of Inviſible Beings; the ſecond, of the Nature of a Spirit; in which I laid down for a Ground, That the Right apprehenſion of the Divine Nature and Being, is the Key of the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Mans Soul. As therefore I endeavour'd to explain thoſe two Points by it, ſo I come now more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to purſue the Reſemblance the Soul
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:179741:66"/> of Man hath with God, and in this next place to ſpeak of it in the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, Force, and Excellency of its Being and Faculties; firſt taking oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to make this induſtrious Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion upon the Souls likeneſs to God.</p>
            <p>It is an uſual Obſervation, That every Creature reſembles God in that very regard that it hath a Being, however obſcure it be; and the more any Creature advances in Being, the clearer the Repreſentation of God, till the Scale of Creatures leads us up to thoſe that God hath exalted into the neareſt likeneſs to himſelf that Created Natures are capable of; and theſe are <hi>Rational Spirits, Angels, and Souls of Men;</hi> of which, Angels are a higher Order, and at greater Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, being out of Bodies; and the Souls of Men a lower Order, being under the diſadvantage of Bodies; yet in themſelves like to God, and like to Angels.</p>
            <p>Now it is the Privilege of Spirits to behold in the whole Creation, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in their own Natures, the great Perfections of God ſurmounting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves (and much more the reſt of the Creatures) as Infinite doth Finite;
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:179741:66"/> that ſo God may be underſtood, and accordingly ador'd by them; ſeeing Spirits in his own Image of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and Likeneſs can alone ſo far know him, as in a true and proper ſenſe to adore him: and the Glory of God in ſuch an Adoration being the end of Creation, it argues the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of ſuch Creatures, and ſo accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd, thus to give him his Glory.</p>
            <p>As therefore, by reviews of the Creatures in general, and particularly of our own Minds, and by Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of what excells amongſt all, it is poſſible without Scripture, though more darkly, to find out the Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are to be aſcrib'd infinitely to God; and when we come to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and find that agreeing with (though exceeding) Natural Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, in its Attributions to God, we have by this combination of Scripture and Reaſon, Revealed and Natural Knowledge, (the praeeminence being eaſily yielded to Revealed) the moſt ſatisfying Aſſurances of God we can have.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, by conſidering the Excellencies and Perfections attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to God in his Word, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:179741:67"/> the ſame Lines drawn upon our own Minds, obſervable both in the Diſcourſes of Scripture concerning them, and in our own experience (though but according to the degree and model of Creatures) we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand our own Souls more fully; ſo that, as the conſideration of our ſelves &amp; the Creatures, leads us without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation to underſtand God, though not ſo clearly; ſo theſe Oracles re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing God, and all his Attributes more certainly and evidently to us, reveal alſo our ſelves more plainly, becauſe they tell us, we are made in <hi>his Image and Likeneſs;</hi> and ſo by knowing God with greateſt clearneſs, we know our ſelves alſo moſt clearly: for the Knowledge of our ſelves (as to what concerns the clearneſs of it) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon our Knowledge of God by the Scriptures, more than our Knowledge of God depends upon the Knowledge of our ſelves by Natural Knowledge, without Scripture: Yet ſtill the Knowledge of our own Souls, where Men have no Revelation, leads them beſt to the Knowledge of God; as the Knowledge of God by Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, leads us beſt to the Knowledge
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:179741:67"/> of our own Souls; becauſe God and the Soul do mutually repreſent one another: God, the Original Proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type, and Infinite Exemplar; Man's Soul, the humble Repreſentation and Copy: Upon which Reaſon the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle having ſaid, <hi>We are his off-ſpring,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Acts 17. 28, 29.</note> immediately argues, <hi>Foraſmuch as we are the off-ſpring of God, we ought not to think the Godhead like to ſilver and gold.</hi> Our own Nature deriving from God, inſtructs us better concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him: for ſeeing we our ſelves far excel all thoſe things, however height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Art, he that gave us thoſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies, muſt needs have them in himſelf, and in a tranſcendency; As <hi>he that built the houſe, hath more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour than the houſe,</hi> and the Life ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels the Picture: So, on the other ſide, the Excellencies and Perfections of the Divine Being are every where given us in Scripture as the Rule of Compoſure for Man's Soul; which could not be reaſonable, were not the being of it firſt given in <hi>the Image and Likeneſs of God,</hi> and ſuſceptive of the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> that is, of the Virtues of it.</p>
            <p>Touching the Souls Likeneſs to
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:179741:68"/> Angels, we need not labour much, but rather in comparing them with God the Original of both, and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally onely illuſtrate the Doctrine of the Soul, by obſervation of what we are taught in inſpir'd Leaves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them, though Philoſophy hath not been altogether ignorant herein. In general, they are of a middle ſtate between God and us; nearer to God, in that they are a higher Rank of Spirits, diſengag'd from Body; much nearer to us, in that they are Finite Spirits, and God infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely above them.</p>
            <p>In ſpeaking then of the Likeneſs of Man's Soul to God, we muſt again have recourſe to his Creation, and when God had ſaid, <hi>Let us make Man in our own Likeneſs and Image,</hi> and form'd the Body, as a curious Statua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry doth a moſt exact Statue, he then <hi>breath'd into it the Breath of Life.</hi> Now this <hi>Breathing of God</hi> argues, he gave a great ſemblance of himſelf, and that God deriv'd ſomething from himſelf to Man's Soul, that ſhould more immediately expreſs himſelf, and was taken from himſelf as the Life. Thus our Saviour <hi>breath'd upon his</hi>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:179741:68"/> 
               <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and made them Partakers of a Spirit that had a great Likeneſs to his own, in the Infallibility and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venlineſs of his Doctrine, the Power of working Miracles, the Holineſs of their Miniſtry, and whole Apoſtolick Function. God <hi>breathing</hi> Mans Soul, it became ſo like him, that ſome have call'd it, A Particle of the Divinity, a Kiſs of God, an Imprint of himſelf.</p>
            <p>Now this Likeneſs of Man's Soul to God, I believe not to be firſt in thoſe moral Reſemblances of the Truth, Holineſs, and Goodneſs of God, which ſpeak God the beſt, and in which to be like God, is Mans Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitude and Integrity, and the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of his Happineſs as a Rational Agent, nor onely in the Intellectual Faculties; but alſo in thoſe Attributes which ſpeak God the Greateſt, though theſe be in this preſent ſtate of Man much obſcured, even as the other.</p>
            <p>Of the Soul of Man, an Inviſible Spirit, hath been already diſcours'd: Of other the Greatneſſes of God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a glance, an eye of themſelves upon Mans Soul, we may alſo appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend;</p>
            <p>There is a Reſemblance of his Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niteneſs
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:179741:69"/> and Ubiquity of Preſence, in that ſwift and ſudden Motion of Mans Soul from Eaſt to Weſt, ſummoning things of fartheſt diſtance into its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence by Thought and Intellectual Conſideration; the Intelligence he endeavours to hold with all the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Buſineſs of the World, both Natural, Civil, and Moral; the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondency he hath with Things Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Heavenly. The Freedom and Liberty of the Increated Will is reflected in ſome degree in the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Mans Will, that can be no way forc'd or compell'd; in the vaſtneſs of his Appetite and Deſire, which though now irregular, yet ſpeaks the Original Greatneſs of his Soul, and that Joy unſpeakable he was intended for: The Dominion of God, in Mans Dominion over the Creatures, and the vaſt and reſtleſs Ambition and Deſire of Power and Empire ſo natural to him: The Eternity of God, in the Immortality, and at laſt Unchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs given to Mans Soul: The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Bleſſedneſs, in the Luſtre and Glory Man affects, the Well-being he ſo inſeparably from his Nature deſires, the Happineſs he is capable of, to
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:179741:69"/> which he was deſign'd, and to which he is exalted by the <hi>Salvation of Chriſt.</hi> From hence there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like Creation, in the great Works that have been done by Men; and ſomething in Humane Contrivan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Adminiſtrations, like Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
            <p>And that there is a Force and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency of Mans Spirit, in a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion reſembling that Power of God that brings Things to paſs in Matter, or like the force of Angels, that have wrought upon Matter beyond all the Activity that Matter can be ſet into by any Material Agency, is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out probability, from the more than ordinary vigorous Action and great Strength of ſome Men, as <hi>Samſon,</hi> and ſome others of <hi>unuſual Force:</hi> For I am much inclin'd, under the Divine Efficacy concurring, to aſcribe ſuch Might to the Soul, either acting it ſelf by extraordinary Organs and Inſtruments of Body prepar'd and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for that Might, as in Gyants, and ſuch like; or that God may have made uſe of ſome Good Men, in a degree like the Angels, letting out the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of their Souls through their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:179741:70"/> into Actions, above the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Mankind; to which I am very ſubject to attribute thoſe <hi>Famous Acts</hi> recorded by the Apoſtle, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11. 33, 34. <hi>They ſubdued Kingdoms, ſtopped the mouths of Lions, quenched the violence of Fire, eſcaped the edge of the ſword, out of weakneſs were made ſtrong, waxed valiant in Fight, put to flight the Armies of the Aliens:</hi> For, though theſe are miraculous, compar'd with the ordinary State of Mankind, yet they may be natural to the unconfined State of the Soul, in its Efficacies upon Matter; even as <hi>working Righteouſneſs, obtaining Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, not accepting deliverance, that they might be partakers of a better Reſurrection,</hi> require as ſupernatural an aſſiſtance of Mind, in this degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy of Mankind, and do as much exceed the Poſſibilities of the Soul, ſo ſunk and degraded, as the other do the Powers of a Spirit ſhut up in Fleſh, and in this State of Humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And yet certainly all Acts of Goodneſs and Obedience to God, are connatural to the true and unfallen Condition of Mankind.</p>
            <p>Now what the Skill and Force of
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:179741:70"/> a Spirit not reſtrain'd and confin'd to work by juſt ſuch Inſtruments of Body, is in moving Matter with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt advantage, and moſt ſucceſsful operation, is to us hard to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd; for the Motion and Activity of it is Intellectual, and (as we ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily conceive) that alone is a feeble thing; yet when we come to obſerve what is attributed to Divine Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, <hi>That by Wiſdom the Lord</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Prov. 3. 19.</note> 
               <hi>founded the Earth, and by <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he eſtabliſhed and garniſhed the Heavens;</hi> and that he onely <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by his Word</hi> the Pleaſure and Determination of his Underſtanding, in the creating every thing, we may be very ready to conceive Infinite Underſtanding is Infinite Power; and when <hi>Wiſdom</hi> ſays, <hi>I am <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Prov. 8. 14.</note> 
               <hi>I have Strength,</hi> it gives us the Notion of Infinite Underſtanding, as Infinite Strength: and if we conſider, Wiſdom and Power are one in God, it ſtill heightens the apprehenſion: and further, if we underſtand, with many Divines, the <hi>Son of God</hi> to be this <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> the Notion is yet rais'd higher, and we underſtand the more by it the Omnipotency of Wiſdom.
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:179741:71"/> Creation then is the very Effect of Infinite Underſtanding; and as all Conceptions, Arguments, Reaſons of Diſcourſe, are the unqueſtionable Creatures of our Underſtanding; ſo all things that are in the World are the Effects of Infinite Underſtanding: the World is the Creature of Divine Underſtanding. His very conceiving things, with a pleaſure they ſhould be, gave them Being; <hi>He ſpake the word,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 33. 9.</note> 
               <hi>and it was done; he commanded, and it ſtood faſt: He called to the Heavens, and they ſtood up together:</hi> There was no other Power us'd by God, that we read of. Thus Men of great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority ſit ſtill, and ſpeak things into their Execution. As for the mighty Acts of Angels recorded in Scripture, they are veiled as to the manner of their being brought to paſs, and the Efficiency that did produce them; onely we read in that Emblem of the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> wherein all World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things are preſented as governed by God, and adminiſtred by Angels, that the various Rotations and Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in this World, ſhadowed by <hi>Wheels, are full of Eyes,</hi> that is, of the Wiſdom of God, the Supreme Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:179741:71"/> of them, and that they are mov'd on by the Motion of Angels: <hi>For the Spirit of the Living Creatures</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 1. 18, 20.</note> (by which Angels are expreſs'd) <hi>was in the Wheels; and when theſe went, the Wheels went; and when theſe ſtood ſtill, the Wheels ſtood ſtill; This Spirit of the Living Creatures</hi> managed all: So that it looks to us, as if the Angels did all by their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit or Eſſence, and that we know is Intellectual: <hi>Eyes in the Wheels,</hi> and <hi>the Spirit in the Wheels,</hi> turn'd all about. The Angels are Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings inferiour to God onely, and their Efficacy is repreſented to us by <hi>Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> or the moſt vehement <hi>Flame of Fire.</hi> When we come down to Man, we find the Creatures in great ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to <hi>Adam;</hi> and there is reaſon <note place="margin">Geneſ. 2. 20.</note> to think, it was to his Underſtanding they paid their Homage: For as an Introduction to his Rule over them, they were brought to him by God, to receive their Names from him; and according to his inſight into their Natures, <hi>he called them all by their Names,</hi> and ſo entred into his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over them, by underſtanding them, and declaring his underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:179741:72"/> of them. This was the ſolemn Act of his Inauguration into his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual Government. Even as God, who governeth the Stars by his Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Underſtanding, <hi>telleth the number</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 147. 4.</note> 
               <hi>of the Stars, and calleth them all by their names;</hi> thus the known Wiſdom of Men of great Underſtanding com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the Regard and Obedience of thoſe whom they have impos'd Names of Office and Service upon.</p>
            <p>In the generality of Mankind, let us conſider how immediately any, or all the Members of the Body move, upon the moſt ſilent intimations of the Underſtanding, and follow its guidance, twining every way, even into the greateſt Curioſities of Art; ſtretching themſelves to the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious and laborious Employments, adventuring themſelves upon the greateſt Hazards. We ſee, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed all things that are done by Men in the World, begin at the Counſel, Deſign, and Intendments of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; and that the Contrivance of one Mans Underſtanding, dictating to the Underſtandings of thoſe that are under, hath been the Spring, and given production to the mightieſt Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:179741:72"/> the wiſeſt Polities, the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Laws, huge Volumes, the greateſt Atchievements of Armies, the moſt magnificent Buildings, Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Empire, the moſt memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Projects and Works of Art, the Force of ſtrange Engines, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is accounted of Grandeur in the World: The Force of Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hath been given and conveyed from Hand to Hand, inſinuated into Matter, and ſo paſs'd from one Piece and Part of it to another, till it hath reach'd unto, and reſted in the Effect. All this put together, may be an Eſſay concerning the Power of Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>Now what ways Underſtanding hath to move Matter, immediately by it ſelf, we are no competent Judges, that have indeed Underſtandings, but generally ſo reſtrain'd and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd, that they can find the way of doing little, in compariſon of what may be done by that uncontrovertible way of accompliſhing Effects by the mediatory Services of Matter: One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this we know, When there was neither Matter to work upon, nor work with, Infinite Underſtanding
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:179741:73"/> brought forth Matter, and ſtirr'd it as he pleas'd. And though there is no compariſon between Underſtanding Finite, and Infinite; yet by this it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, there is no contradiction for Underſtanding to produce Matter, when there was none; nor to move it, when it is. We know too, there muſt be ſome way, by which our Souls, though acknowledged to be Spirits, move our Bodies, known enough to be groſs and material, and that meerly by Thought and Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration what is to be done; and that they obey them ſpeedily, and with eaſe: although we are not able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedite all the Queſtions that may be mov'd in relation hereunto.</p>
            <p>In the ſum, I think it not to be doubted, but that many of the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary and wonderful Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Men, the even prodigious Valours and mighty Prevalencies of ſome Warriours, that have in heat of Fight mov'd like Lightning, have been the true and proper Effects and Sallies out of a Soul, through the Freedoms given by God to ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, for the bringing about thoſe Changes he hath reſolv'd upon, by
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:179741:73"/> their Victoriouſneſs and Conqueſts. And, to conclude, in all thoſe things that have been done by Men, not plainly miraculous, nor exceeding the Power of Created Spirits, I know no reaſon why the Wonder ſhould be plac'd any where elſe, but upon that admirable Freedom ſuch Souls, by eſpecial Grant from God, have had to work like themſelves, and ſo to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the ordinary Operations of Men. And though this doth not equal their preſent State to, nor bring up their Services to the Services of Angels, that Order of Creatures God in his Wiſdom hath appointed for the greater and more remarkable Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions and Actions in the World, as being always ready, and, as we ſay, <hi>in procinctu, excelling</hi> in prepared and unincumbred <hi>ſtrength,</hi> always upon the guard, and <hi>hearkning to the voice of his word:</hi> yet in that <hi>ſuch great and mighty Works do ſhew forth them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves</hi> in the Soul, and there have been ſo great and wonderful Perſons in all Ages, of Famous Memory in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral kinds and vertues, in whom the Greatneſs of this Soul hath broken forth; it is a marvellous Inſtance, that
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:179741:74"/> the Soul of Man is a Great, Potent, and Excellent Spirit, of vaſt Activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in its own Nature; and that it hath a near reſemblance of God, and Alliance to Angels: that however <hi>it be for a little time made lower than Angels,</hi> yet it ſhall be brought into a Condition wherein it ſhall be <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, equal to Angels.</p>
            <p>For though I make no doubt ſome Men have greater Souls than others, as one Star differs from another in Magnitude, and as Bodies differ in Strength, Beauty, and Proportion; yet there is the main Excellency of a Humane Body, wherein all agree: So it is in the Souls of Men; the Soul of one Man is a Meaſure, and carries the Pourtraicture of the Souls of Men in their Univerſal Nature; <hi>even as Face anſwers Face in the water,</hi> ſo the Soul of one Man returns the Soul of another Man.</p>
            <p>Againſt all this it lies as a great Objection, That the greateſt Effects of a Soul we can obſerve, are not great and high enough for ſuch a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as I have deſcrib'd Mans Soul to be; and the great Effects we do ſee, are found onely in ſome leſſer num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:179741:74"/> of Men. Let us then inquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe two things; Why the Effects are not greater, wherein Souls diſplay themſelves? and, Why we ſee them not more generally and univerſally among Men?</p>
            <p>For the firſt, it is to be conſidered, The Soul in the Body is like an Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, that works by a very dull and unapt Inſtrument, though himſelf of excellent Skill; like a valiant War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour with a Sword of Lead, or as <hi>Samſon,</hi> if confin'd to the general Laws of Humane Nature, he had fought with the <hi>Jaw-bone of an Aſs</hi> onely; or like the Eye, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo quick, looking through a dull Glaſs, or in a Dark Room; or like a ſtrong and valorous Man in a Cage, or cloſe Dungeon; or like a Light in a Dark Lantern; or like a ſtrong Man aſleep: All this is the State of the Soul in the Body; or like a Prince of Juſt Authority, in Captivity; or like a Jewel clos'd up in Clay; or a Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhrouded under a courſe Cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>To judge of the Soul now, and according to ſuch Rules as it acts by in the Body, that it ſhall never be
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:179741:75"/> greater and more active than it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, is to conclude the Soul of a Child ſhall never ſhew it ſelf greater and more active than it appears while the Child is in Swadling Clothes: Or, as if the Infant in the Cloyſter of the Womb, could make a Judgment of it ſelf, and think it ſelf in as good a condition, or better, than it ſhould be in the open Air; and that what it is there, it muſt be always. The Soul ſees now <hi>through a glaſs darkly,</hi> and is in the condition of a Child, and of a Child ſhut up in the Womb.</p>
            <p>That the Body is now a great hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance to the Soul, is apparent by the neceſſity that the Soul muſt be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from it, and that it muſt be diſſolv'd into <hi>Duſt,</hi> or <hi>changed;</hi> and that in the Reſurrection, our Bodies muſt be <hi>Spiritual Bodies,</hi> fit to caſt the Glories and diſplay the Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of a Soul, to diſcharge the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities of the higheſt Elevation of a Spirit. But to return to the preſent State of the Soul in the Body, why it is order'd thus? that the Body ſhould be ſuch an Inſtrument out of Tune, to the Soul, ſuch an excellent Harmoniſt; ſuch a Dungeon to the Mind, Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:179741:75"/> in its Creation. We may give it thus.</p>
            <p>In the very firſt and moſt innocent ſtate, the Soul was ſo framed by God, that though the Powers of it were much larger than Body, and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent upon it, yet that they ſhould for a certain ſeaſon be reſtrain'd to the Body, to govern, take care of, and act it according to its Nature and Meaſures, according to its Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to run along under the Powers of the Soul, in their Motion, and not be deſtroy'd by the over-vehemency.</p>
            <p>This Body the Soul was able and fit to act to the utmoſt of its Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and far beyond them; and yet it was ſo moderated, as not to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act them: but it could not raiſe this Body, or the Matter of it, above its Natural Excellency: That was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd in the Creators Power alone, as a Reward of the Souls Obedience in that Body for the preſent time al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted to it.</p>
            <p>The Soul could not make the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy what it would have it be, or fit it to all it would have it do, when it found it ſhort: It could not enable body to all things a Soul had Power
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:179741:76"/> for, or a deſire to: For it was but a <hi>Living Soul,</hi> and not a <hi>Quickning</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 45.</note> 
               <hi>Spirit;</hi> that is, It had a Life given it by God, and ſuch a Life, that it ſhould be always a <hi>Living Soul,</hi> that it ſhould never decay, and fall down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Dead Thing; and ſo it could retain its own Life, againſt any one but the Author of it, and loſe none of that; <hi>for this power it had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from God;</hi> and what it found fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God to its Activity, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venienc'd to its Life, it could act, quicken, and manage: But it was not <hi>a Quickning Spirit;</hi> that is, It had not power to make or give a new Life, to continue a Body in Life, or to raiſe a Dead Body, or make it more Excellent or Lively than it found it prepared by God: It had not a Power <hi>like the Firſt-begotten from the Dead,</hi> who can make <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible put on Incorruption,</hi> and <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal put on Immortality, and be even ſwallowed up of Life; who can change our vile Bodies, that they may be made like his glorious Body, by a Power that ſubdues all things to it ſelf.</hi> So then, though the Soul could work to the utmoſt extent of Matter and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:179741:76"/> and fill all Bodily Capacities, yet it could not exceed them, nor act according to it ſelf, becauſe it was confin'd in Body; but muſt work and act onely as the Soul of ſuch a Body: nor could it quicken and advance Body, as it would it ſelf, nor better it above its Rank and Order ſet by the Creator; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Soul could diſplay it ſelf, and its own Spirituality, onely ſo far as Body, made by God, the Body of this Soul, could receive and convey into Action.</p>
            <p>And though this was enough, not onely to prefer Man to the top of this Lower Creation, and to make him under the Creator <hi>Lord of All;</hi> but to aſſure enough, <hi>a greater than Body, even a Spirit was there:</hi> yet it could not diſcover, how great and potent this Spirit was.</p>
            <p>Thus the Soul was ſubmitted by the wiſe Ordination of God, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, keep home, and dwell in a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, being at the very firſt ſet in an Orb lower than it ſelf, and to manage <hi>fewer</hi> and <hi>leſſer Talents,</hi> according to the State of the Lower Creation; and ſo by its Obedience, Fidelity, and
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:179741:77"/> Improvement, to be advanc'd <hi>to rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and more Talents, and to a Rule over greateſt Cities;</hi> that is, to be exalted to the Heights and full Glory of a perfecteſt Immortality.</p>
            <p>Thus was the State of Innocency, wherein Body was much more fitted to the Excellency of the Soul, though not to all its Excellency; fitted to it onely according to the Lower State of Man in this World, not according to that Supreme State of Immortality; but differing as much from that, as Poſſibility not to die, doth from an Impoſſibility to die; or as <hi>a Body Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,</hi> juſt fit to entertain a Soul in a temporary condition, and to yield it ſelf to its diſplays in a degree conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to that, differs from a <hi>Body Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual,</hi> fram'd to bear and diſcharge all the higheſt Spiritualities of a Soul, in its unchangeable Eſtate.</p>
            <p>Yet this was much above the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Condition of Body under Sin; even as Innocency, and the Order, Beauty, and Goodneſs wherein Man was firſt enſtated by God, excell the Guilt, unnatural Deformity, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion he labours under now: Since Sin and Diſobedience, the Souls man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:179741:77"/> of Habitation in Body, is fallen much lower; and it is carefully to be conſider'd, how it fell lower: for it cannot be conceived, that any thing ſhould be abated from the Life, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, and Force of the Soul it ſelf: The Soul loſes onely in the Holy and Happy State of it, without any dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution in its Eſence, or Eſſential Life; for it cannot loſe in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of thoſe: It muſt loſe in the whole, or not at all; being one, whole, intire, indiviſible Self, as hath been before aſſerted: And thus it is onely a competent Subject for the Happineſs or Miſery of Eternity, of which Fallen Angels are a plain In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, who, notwithſtanding their Fall, continue <hi>Principalities, and Powers, and Dominions;</hi> and though <hi>Wickedneſſes,</hi> yet <hi>Spiritual Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and in High Places.</hi> The Soul then loſing nothing thus, the Life, Vigour, and Vertue of its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture muſt lie cloſe, accumulated and folded up, where there is not room for an Explanation and free Expatiation; as Light, that could reach much further, when ſtopp'd by any Dark Body, is reverberated into it ſelf.</p>
            <pb n="140" facs="tcp:179741:78"/>
            <p>We muſt therefore conceive, that, as a Puniſhment upon the Sin of Man, there is a great withdrawing of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Bleſſing from the Lower Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; upon which enſues an interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the benign Order of Things one towards another, ſo that they are continually at feud, and in conteſt one with another, hindering, diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and mutually abating the Force, and working to the deſtruction one of another: to all which Inconveniences the Humane Body becomes ſubject, and both in regard of its Temper and Compoſition, more ſubject than ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other parts of Matter; <hi>for its Strength is not the Strength of Stones, nor its Fleſh of Braſs,</hi> nor clear and pure like the Heavens, <hi>that abide of old.</hi> Further, It being the Body of that Soul, that is the great Offender, it is moſt liable to the Curſe: The Soul then, whoſe Body was at firſt too narrow for all its Efficacies, is now limited to one, unequal to any one of them, and very diſturbing of their Execution.</p>
            <p>For ſometimes, by the oppreſſion of other Parts of Matter upon this Body, all the livelier and brisker Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:179741:78"/> of it are ſqueez'd out and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haled, whereby it becomes dull and inſtagnated; ſometimes it is overheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into furious and inordinate motion, and ſo weakned and diſordered in its great end of ſerving the Soul.</p>
            <p>The Soul on the other ſide loſing nothing of it ſelf, yet being ſunk down from the Intellectual Spiritual Life, and from the Happineſs therein to be found, which is its true Sphere, becomes alſo negligent of act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and invigorating the Body, and guiding the Service of it to ſuch wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Ends; and with a wilful ſupine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs falls down into the Animal Life, and preſently finding what State and Temper that Body with which it is joyn'd is of, carries it ſelf, with all its Powers, almoſt wholly thither.</p>
            <p>If it be a duller Matter or Body, it ſtays its own Effluxes, the Stream of its Motion, and taſtes its Life and Enjoyment in that ſloathfulneſs and ſluggiſhneſs of Fleſh, as it were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting it hath any greater Virtue, Force, or other Office, than what ſerves to the maintenance of ſo low a Life; that the Soul wilfully ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates, and deadens its own Activity,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:179741:79"/> by ſlumbring it in the drowſineſs of a lazie Body; ſo that this Sloath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the greateſt of all Sloath, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Pleaſure this mighty Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit hath in that Sloath, having found it to be the Temper of that Matter wherein it hath ſheath'd it ſelf; there being in this very Sloath, as Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers teach of Reſt of Bodies, as forcible and great a Cauſe, as there is of Motion. Thus the great Force of a Soul is defeated this way, the Body being like damp'd Powder, that will not take the Fire, and ſo the Fire lies ſtill and does nothing: to ſuch <hi>Solomon</hi> cries out, <hi>Yet a little ſleep, a little ſlumber, a little folding of the hands to ſleep;</hi> the deſcription of an endleſs and incurable Sloath, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24. 33. If the Body be a Compoſure more lively and ſpirituous, and apt to overheat, the Soul preſently finds this, and committing it ſelf to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations of Body, ſuch Propenſions are promoted and inraged, according to the mighty Force of a Soul, into the Exceſſes of Luſt, Rage, and all Intemperance, beyond the very Brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Nature, that hath no ſuch Spirit to act it: and thus alſo the Might of
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:179741:79"/> the Soul is loſt, as the Force of the Fire with the Powder in a crack'd or foul Gun, that is ſcatter'd, and recoils with miſchief; or as an over-meaſure of Powder, taking fire without dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; the Effect of which is the ſlaughter and deſtruction of all about it. So that every way nothing is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieved worthy the Greatneſs of this Spirit.</p>
            <p>Thus the Soul is doubly diſabled by Matter, wherein it is ſet; both becauſe that Matter is ſubject to ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſorders, that can no way be perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly cured, and ſo it is unfit for the Souls uſe; and alſo, becauſe the Soul crowds up its own Activities into a contentment with what it finds moſt natural and ready in that Matter with which it is joyned, complies with it, and troubles it ſelf no further to amend it: and the longer things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſo, the more ſtiff and unreform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able the Evil grows. All which put together, is a plain Reaſon, why there are no greater Effects of a Soul in the World, and how it comes to paſs, that the multitude of People in it give no other evidence of a Soul, but in a proviſion of Natural Life, and
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:179741:80"/> the Senſualities of Life, ſomewhat above the Rank of Beaſts.</p>
            <p>Now upon the utmoſt ſtretch of this Reaſon, there would be no Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of greater Vertue or Heroick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs among Men: But becauſe this State both of the Body and the Soul is below the Graciouſneſs of the firſt Creation, and that there are moſt merciful Relaxations of the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due to the Sin of Man, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Advantages for the betterment of both Soul and Body, vouchſafed by God through <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Mediator, whoſe Benefits extend to them that do not know him; hence it is, that the State of Mankind excells it ſelf in many great Inſtances.</p>
            <p>For the Soul retaining its primitive Vigour and Life, which are its very Nature and Being; and Body being capable of Refinement to better uſe, by the care of the Soul in the Subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of it; even as Art poliſhes the Rude Matter, directs it into the uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of any Inſtrument; as Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry purifies and exalts it; as the Skill of the Apothecary corrects, and makes it medicinable: ſo the Soul deſigning to mend the Body, ſets the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:179741:80"/> Characters of Wiſdom, Virtue, and good Ingeny upon it, formes it to a graceful Mine and Deportment, turns and twiſts the Motions of it to the Curioſities of Artifice, chaſtiſes and reforms it to the Precepts of Virtue, and ſubdues it to the Induſtry of Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Contemplation, hardens it to the fearleſs and reſolv'd Actions of War, quickens it to Service in greateſt Works and Undertakings, with what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever elſe we ſee in the World worthy of conſideration to this purpoſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Inſpiration of Mind, and the Performance of Body commanded by it.</p>
            <p>Now that which under ſuch Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures excites the Souls of Men to theſe Aſpirings, muſt chiefly be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to Divine Impreſſions, awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening ſome Mens Spirits to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of their richer and worthier Faculties; of which Scripture gives abundant Teſtimony in all kinds: And under this, they may be aſcrib'd to the different Magnitudes of Souls, or the more advantageous Bodies Providence hath contriv'd for ſome, rather than for others; and then to the Inſtruction and Examples that fall
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:179741:81"/> from ſuch Perſons, as Influences from the Heavenly Bodies, and have their Effects upon many, not onely of one Age or Country, but of far diſtant Places, and ſucceeding Times; ſo that there have been ſtill ſpringing up great and incomparable Perſons, Mirrours of the Greatneſs and Potency of a Humane Spirit, and their Actions as Monuments of it; and under them, multitudes of others, though not of ſo high a degree, yet endeavouring to raiſe themſelves ſomewhat towards the Excellencies of Humane Nature.</p>
            <p>But why upon theſe ſo fair Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages the Excellency of Mans Soul is not more generally retrived, may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this farther Reſolution.</p>
            <p>As the Soul working by Body, muſt have a well fitted and prepared Body to work immediately by; ſo it's fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neceſſary to its Operations by Body, that there be a conveniency and an accommodation of ſeveral In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments and Materials, beſides and beyond Body, for it to employ the Miniſteries of Body upon, and to work at a diſtance by, that the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be memorable and great. He that will build, <hi>muſt firſt ſit down</hi>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:179741:81"/> 
               <hi>and count the Charge: The King that goes to War, muſt conſider the ſtrength of his Armies,</hi> the number of his Men, the Conduct and Reſolution of his Captains, the ſufficiency of his Treaſure: <hi>He that ſeparates himſelf to intermeddle with all Knowledge,</hi> muſt be furniſh'd with the external, as well as the internal Means of Science; elſe his Succeſs can never amount to Eminency.</p>
            <p>Now the preſent State of the World is ſo impoveriſh'd by the Sin of Man, that it can ſupply but Few, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of the Many; ſo that the ſtrait and low Condition, the unattempting Education and manner of Life, that very many, the moſt of Mankind are confin'd to, by reaſon of Want, fore-prizes the nobler Darings of their Mind, and plunges them ſo low, that they cannot eaſily riſe. The Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this Caſe have been very no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in ſundry Perſons, whoſe Souls have been kept low, and ſuppreſs'd by the lowneſs and narrowneſs of (as they are call'd) their Fortunes; but have ſpread and ſoar'd aloft, when their Sphere of Action hath been made more ample and high, by acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:179741:82"/> of thoſe Fortunes: and we need not make any doubt, but that if the Train had been laid in their Youth to Generous Employment, they would have much more excell'd; ſeeing their Souls have, as it were, ſtarted out in their riper years to worthy Menages, being encourag'd by plenty of Means, when their Education had been ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did. And the ſame thing is propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably to be believ'd of very many, who yet live and die obſcure and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd, and <hi>their name in darkneſs,</hi> through Prejudices of a poor Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, while their Souls are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as great as any.</p>
            <p>And indeed, it is not intended by God, the degenerate State of this World ſhould be ſo noble or free, as to bear up the true and native Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Souls in a Multitude, and at their full extent of Action; any more than he hath prepar'd the Firmament for many Suns. A World of Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages, Great for their Proweſs, Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, Learning, and Wiſdom, would exalt this State too high: It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo ordered, that the Spirits of the moſt lie ſtill and contracted by the very cloſeneſs of their Condition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:179741:82"/> other Miſadventures; and are ſo diverted upon the little things they have to do with, and ſo ſtraitned by them, that they think of nothing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and if they do, yet finding no ſcope or opportunity, they repent the Attempt, and retreat back again.</p>
            <p>For alas, the Neceſſities of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in theſe Bodies are ſo conſuming and expenſive, and the Riches of the Creation hidden deep, and removed far from uſe, or elſe ſcanty, and daily waſted, that but ſome of Mankind can be ſet out for Glory, and their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings equipp'd for Grandeur: for, what one Man hath, and uſes, another wants; the Abundance of that one Man, is the Poverty of many about him: How few then can make proof of the Deſigns and Action of a Soul?</p>
            <p>Further, there are continual Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plantations and Underminings of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, and the Virtue of it, by it ſelf; the Endeavours of ſome to riſe are ſurpriz'd and counter-wrought by the Jealouſies of others, who thereupon ſuſpect their own diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Ruine. The World is full of Suſpicion, Surmiſe, Envy, and ill Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, becauſe there is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:179741:83"/> for this Soul of Man, whereby to ſhew it ſelf as great as it is, and would fain appear to be.</p>
            <p>This Region is ſo ſtinted, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Greater Intelligence in it thinks it could it ſelf enlighten and move the whole, and is offended with a Joynt-Light, as eclipſing and drowning ſome of its own. Heaven onely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertains an innumerable Company of Glorious Spirits, in their full Luſtre: Their number is Ten thouſand times ten thouſand, and thouſands of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, without the jealouſie or envy of any one.</p>
            <p>Yet in this very low condition of Souls, the Soul it ſelf is not the leſs, but conceal'd, as many excellent and moſt potent Things in Nature. A Diamond may be eaſily cover'd, that none of the Beams of it can be ſeen; the ſharp Steel lies quiet in the Sheath; the Fire, that could inflame <hi>the whole Courſe of Nature,</hi> is hid in the Flint: How often is the Glory of the Sun muffled up in a Cloud? And, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend higher, not onely the Angelical, but the Divine Glory is much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, while it is much ſeen: <hi>Verily,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 45. 15.</note> 
               <hi>thou art a God that hideſt thy ſelf,</hi>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:179741:83"/> 
               <hi>O God of Iſrael, the Saviour of thy People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this thing ought not to be to <note place="margin">Practical Inference.</note> us a Matter of meer Notion or Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, but of moſt ſerious conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration: for this Greatneſs and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency of our Souls determines it ſelf ſupremely and finally into an Ability and Power to bear Eternal Happineſs or Miſery; and all elſe is but acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and by the By to it. It was not made great for any <hi>Name</hi> of things, <hi>that is named in this World,</hi> or call'd Great here, how great ſoever. All things that are Arguments of Potency now, do but fall in; the true inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Souls being made ſo puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant a Being, is, that it might ſuſtain <hi>thoſe weights of Glory,</hi> Likeneſs to God, Everlaſting Enjoyment of him, without being fainted or overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: But if it miſcarry from this Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, or fall ſhort of this Glory, all this its Might and Puiſſance enable it ſtill to ſurvive, and bear the maſſie diſpleaſure of God, angry for Sin; and the moſt forcible and terrible Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coils of its own guilty and enraged ſelf, upon it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Now a Being thus Potent and Great,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:179741:84"/> as to ſubſiſt in that Everlaſting Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs or Miſery, can together, and comprehenſively do thoſe ſmaller Great things that are eſteem'd ſo in this World: and yet if it ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver do any ſuch, nor have the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of doing them; to be created to the Intents and Purpoſes of an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Condition, makes it compleatly neceſſary it ſhould be made ſo Great as we have aſſerted: And if it were not ſo, we could make but a very imperfect account, to what ends the Souls of ſome Princely and incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Young Men are prepared; whoſe riſing and growing Vertue appears onely ſo long, as to ſpring Heroickly, and to give proof of a Divineneſs in the Bud, and then by Death to fade in this World, as early as it bloſſoms, and have no opportunity left to ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen. In theſe at once we ſee both the Greatneſs of a Soul, and that this World is not its proper Sphere, or ſo much as near it; for if it were, ſuch Souls had been made in vain ſo Great: But the State of Eternity ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies the Wiſdom of God, in breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo rich a Principle of Life, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſo little Action here;
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:179741:84"/> becauſe what is ſo ſuperabundant now, is then all of uſe, and nothing to ſpare.</p>
            <p>And to preſs this Conſideration fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and more generally, the State of Eternity reduces the Souls of Men univerſally to thus much of Equality, that they are all alike ſtripp'd out of the Cumber and Incommodiouſneſs of a Body, and brought to the naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſimplicity of Spirit, which is the greateſt Advancement of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in an abſtract Notion of Being, that a Creature is or can be receptive of. Nor is Spiritual Motion fetter'd or tied up any longer by indigency of ſubſervient Miniſteries: All have that which is full enough to their State.</p>
            <p>Souls are then at the height of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality and Unchangeableneſs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Full-ſail Activity, every way equal to ſo great a Nature, whether it be employ'd in Fruitions or Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances.</p>
            <p>Let us then expatiate thus into Meditation: We that are but of ſo many Foot of Body, and muſt be lodg'd in ſo many Foot of Earth, the meaſure of the Grave, have Souls whoſe Capacities and Action are vaſter
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:179741:85"/> than the whole Creation of Matter: <hi>We that dwell in houſes of clay, and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Job 4. 19.</note> 
               <hi>have our foundation in the duſt,</hi> have yet great and potent Souls. If we could perſwade our ſelves we are more than <hi>this Hand-breadth</hi> of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Condition, and preſent Life, we ſhould prepare our ſelves for ſo great a State of Being, the State that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to Souls. All we toil and ſweat for, that we deſign and care for in the World, is Self-preſervation, Self-enjoyment, and Well-being: Why then ſhould we not mind theſe in our largeſt and moſt excellent Quality? We value our ſelves in that which is leaſt, and throw our ſelves away in the main and whole Sum.</p>
            <p>Let us then continually reaſon with our ſelves: Our Souls are great; when we go out of the Body, we become <hi>Great Spirits.</hi> However the Soul keep up cloſe in the Body, yet it may be dilated beyond all poſſible Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination; as they ſay, An Angel of Gold may be beaten out to cover a whole Acre of Ground. We ſee to what a vaſtneſs Education, Study, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement in the World, extends the Souls of ſome Men, that made little
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:179741:85"/> appearance at firſt: To how much a more immenſe Amplitude will the State of Eternity ſtretch out the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt of a Soul? and what an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Happineſs or Miſery will it then take in!</p>
            <p>How little then, or how great ſoever we ſeem now, all will then be reſolv'd into this final Condition of our Immortal Souls; and the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of theſe reſts in the Favour of God, a Likeneſs to him in Holineſs, ſpringing out into an Eternal Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him.</p>
            <p>And while we are here in the World, in this State of our Souls lies our true Greatneſs and Worth: Some that ſeem ſo inconſiderable, that no Man looks after them, yet being great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Holy, greatly favoured of God, Great Spirits, all Heavenly, <hi>the world</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Hebr. 11. 37, 38.</note> 
               <hi>is not worthy of them, though they wander up and down on montains, in ſheep-skins, and goat-skins, and be hid in dens and caves of the earth.</hi> Others Great in the World, and being alſo truly Good, <hi>the Back-parts</hi> of their Greatneſs are onely <hi>ſeen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea, even in Bad Men, how ſmall or great ſoever they are in the World,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:179741:86"/> yet that they pertain to an Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Condition, that they have Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Souls, this makes them of greateſt conſideration. <hi>To convert them to God,</hi> is therefore a great and excellent Work: <hi>To ſave a Soul from death,</hi> how great is the Service! and how great is the Reward! They that do it, <hi>ſhall ſhine as the Stars in the Firmament.</hi> How great a Regard to the meaneſt or worſt of Men ſhould it draw, that they pertain to an <hi>Eternal Judgment!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Conſideration of the Soul, as a Being Inviſible, and a Spirit, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving invited an often mention of its Eternal or Unchangeable Condition, to which this preſent State is ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and diſembogues it ſelf into it, as the Rivers do into the Ocean; I come in the next place to make a modeſt Reſearch into the Nature of <hi>Eternity,</hi> and the Souls Relation to it.</p>
            <p>But in ſpeaking of <hi>Eternity,</hi> I know he alone is able to declare it, <hi>who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habits</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 57. 15.</note> 
               <hi>it;</hi> God himſelf, or the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, thoſe Bleſſed Spirits, who were early aſſum'd into larger Participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

            <p>
               <hi>Eternity</hi> then, in its firſt and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Senſe, is not any thing diſtinct from God, but his ſtable unchangeable Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>from everlaſting to everlaſting:</hi> There is no other <hi>Eternity</hi> than this, properly and ſtrictly taken, from which is caſt upon the Mind that contemplates a Being ſo ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with it ſelf, and its own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variable Perfection, a Notion of Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Duration, and that which is comprehended by it; becauſe, by reaſon of the narrowneſs of our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, it is conceiv'd in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction from the Divine Being it ſelf, we in a ſecondary Senſe call <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But even, as what we term <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi> is that which reſults to us from the Notion or Apprehenſion of God the Immenſe Being filling all, ſo much as even Imaginary Space, while he himſelf is the onely <hi>true <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>biquity;</hi> even ſo <hi>Eternity</hi> is the Infiniteneſs of God's Being filling all Imaginary Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and ſo filling it, that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:179741:87"/> Being it ſelf is <hi>that very Eternity,</hi> of which Everlaſting Duration is but the Shadow that falls from it, as Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded Space does from his Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſence.</p>
            <p>God then, <hi>the Supreme Eternal,</hi> or rather <hi>Eternity,</hi> is a Being that muſt always have been, and ever muſt be: It is moſt impoſſible to conceive he ſhould ever not have been, or ever not be: And he is a Being that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver could, and can never be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than he is: So that there are no Marks of Diſtinction that could ever be taken from his Being, or from the State and Condition of his Being. <hi>He is, He was, He is to come,</hi> are all <note place="margin">Rev. 1. 8.</note> united into one Eternal Point or Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod in him, and thus expreſs'd, <hi>I</hi>

               <hi>as yeſterday, when it is paſt; and one day, as a thouſand years.</hi> And if it had been ſaid, Ten thouſand millions of Years are but as a Minute when it is paſt, it had been all one in this Caſe; for there is no New Thing to him, or in him, but all is a Juſt now.</p>
            <p>For his Being is the moſt ſolid ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:179741:87"/> Being, that cannot poſſibly ſubmit to any Alteration: What is Infinitely Perfect, can admit no Change. <hi>This is the One, Juſt, Even, Smooth Eternity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And underſtanding God thus, we underſtand Eternity: And though it be no where but in himſelf, and where he communicates the Likeneſs of it; yet Eternity in a ſecondary Senſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a diſtinct Notion or Senſe of a Mode of Being in our Minds,; and it is a changeleſs Duration of any Being in the ſelf-ſame State; for if there be not Duration, there muſt be Change; and if there be Change, it is not a Duration on all ſides; for then there could be no Change.</p>
            <p>Now this Notion of Eternity could never have come into our Minds, if it had not been planted there by his Hand, who dwells in it, on purpoſe that we might know himſelf by it; nor had there been a ſubſtantial Reſt for ſuch a Conception, if his Being had not given it: All elſe is but Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Duration.</p>
            <p>Eternity then, in this our appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of it, is one great ſmooth Sea, without any Curl of Change; or as
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:179741:88"/> a vaſt unmeaſurable Plain, wherein the Eye hath no Bound, nor ſo much as Note of Diſtinction, no Riſe, no Fall; like a great Mountain, that all Generations have paſs'd and repaſs'd, one hath gone, another come, and that hath ſlidden away too, but the Mountain hath ſtood firm. It is like a Rock, that hath ſtood innumerable Ages, without ſo much as ſcaling; about which the huge Waters have continually wav'd and roll'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and daſh'd aſunder; by which ſmaller Veſſels have paſs'd to and again; gallant Ships, and Potent Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madaes have ſail'd by, and ſunk, or moulder'd away: this in the mean time without any variation.</p>
            <p>It is like an Hour ſpent in higheſt Pleaſure, no Moment, no Minute of which is ſo much as felt. It is like a deep Contemplation, in which the Mind is ſo loſt, ſo retir'd from Body, that it reckons not any Motion, it keeps no account of Time for it, nor obſerves whether any Time paſs'd. It is like an undefinable Point of Juſt now.</p>
            <p>In the next place, to give the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Light to Eternity, let us ſtate the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:179741:88"/> Nature of Time. And Time, to ſpeak ſubſtantially of it, is nothing but the Coming of a Thing, or a World of Things into Being, that were not in Being before. For this makes a new Note in what we conceive, as Durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And therefore when the World was made, the Scripture ſays, <hi>In the Beginning.</hi> There was then a new Date, becauſe there was ſomething then, that had not been before. In Whole Eternity there was nothing New; All was alike One.</p>
            <p>Now theſe things coming in by the way of Change, <hi>viz.</hi> the exchange of the State of Nothing, for the State of Exiſtency, are alſo every Moment ſubject to change, and in a continual hover up and down; and while all theſe things are performing their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in their Changes and Viciſſitudes, the Mind of Man conſidering them under ſuch a Mode or Circumſtance of their Being, there ariſes a Notion or Repreſentation of that whole Space, which putting all together, we call Time in the largeſt ſenſe; of which, that in the <hi>Revelation of St. John</hi> may fitly be underſtood, <hi>Time</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rev. 10. 6.</note> 
               <hi>ſhall be no more;</hi> all Change being
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:179741:89"/> conſummate in the unmoveable State of Eternity. And while it conſiders their particular Flutters hither and thither, it takes Meaſures of the more contingent and unſetled Motion of ſome, by the more ſetled and ſtated Motion of others: of which the Heavenly Bodies, in their conſtant Revolutions of Day and Night, Months and Years, are the ſupreme Standard, and faithful Witneſſes; which the ſame <hi>Divine</hi> expreſſes, by <hi>Time,</hi> and <hi>Times,</hi> and <hi>Half a Time,</hi>

            <p>Below theſe, the Founding and Ruine of Monarchies, the Birth and Death of Princes, make the Publick <hi>Epochs,</hi> and give new Characters to Time, which the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> calls the <hi>changing of Times and Seaſons:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Dan. 2. 21.</note> Even as theſe Changes in the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Private Perſons, make private and particular Diſtinctions of it, in thoſe Places and Families where they are known and taken notice of: Of which <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks, not onely as a

               <hi>Times are in thy hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we could ſuppoſe all things then above us, round about us, within us, even to a thought ſtanding ſtill, and no alteration, ſo much as in a thought; where would be the Meaſure of Time? or what would be the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it? or where would it be at all?</p>
            <p>The Being therefore of the Things of Time, or rather that project, and caſt Time, as a faint Shade from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, are made and fitted to move, and ſhift, and alter; elſe there could be no Time: even as the Being of God, always the ſame, gives us Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: elſe there could be none, but an Imaginary Duration, as hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready aſſerted.</p>
            <p>If any thing therefore in this World ſtands faſter and longer than other, and ſuffers no Change, it becomes a near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Reſemblance of Eternity, as the Hills are call'd <hi>Everlaſting Hills,</hi> and the Eternity of God condeſcends it ſelf to our Thoughts by compare with them: <hi>Before the Hills were</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Now Time, however full of Flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuations it is in it ſelf, can yet make no diſturbance upon Eternity, or at all affect it; all its various Shapes can imprint no Change there: For whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we conſider Eternity as One with God; As our Saviour ſpeaks of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Before Abraham was, I am;</hi> ſo <note place="margin">Joh. 8. 58.</note> it may be ſaid of all the Particulars of Time, Before them, <hi>from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting God is.</hi> His Being did not wait their coming into Being, nor does it lay down it ſelf, when they go out of their preſent Being: <hi>Thou</hi>

               <note place="margin">Pſal. 102. 26, 27.</note> 
               <hi>as a Veſture ſhalt thou change them, and they ſhall be changed: But thou art the ſame for ever, and of thy years there is no end.</hi> Or whether we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider Eternity in a ſecondary Notion, and as we conceive it in Everlaſting Duration; it is always quiet and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted in the Divine Being: There is Duration, without any <hi>ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of change,</hi> which is the abſolute
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:179741:90"/> Eternity, and gives the moſt perfect Notion of it, and is no where to be found, but in God.</p>
            <p>But Time, whether we underſtand it as that ſpace of Duration in which theſe Changeables are running their ſeveral Riſques, it is incircled and comprehended by Eternity, as a Drop by the Ocean, above it, within it, round about it: and indeed it is but the ſame Duration, diſtinguiſh'd one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by thoſe Chequers and Spots of Change upon it: Or if we underſtand by it the Creatures of Time, in thoſe their ſeveral Changes, they are crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and upheld by the Eternal Power: He <hi>that changes Times and Seaſons,</hi> without any Variety in himſelf, rules and governs them all, till at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand they ſurrender themſelves back into that Fixed State his Wiſdom and Righteouſneſs diſpoſes them into for For Ever, to which their Motion in this incertain State prepares them.</p>
            <p>Thus, as all things that move muſt have ſome certain and unſhaken Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom to move upon; and things not ſelf-ſubſiſtent, but dependent, muſt have ſome independent Strength to reſt upon: ſo fluid, and never-reſting,

            </p>
            <p>Now to collect the Sum of this Explication of Eternity, and Time; it is this: Eternity is ſtable and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variable, as the Divine Being that inhabits it, or indeed is Eternity it ſelf. Time, as it includes what we call Duration, is not properly Time; for ſo it falls in with Eternity, as Created Being doth with the Ocean of Being Increated: but as it is in perpetual Change, ſo it is Time, and ſo it falls in with the mutable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that reſide upon it, and are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in thoſe Motions of Change al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to them, the true ſubſtantial Time it ſelf.</p>
            <p>And all this ſpeaks the ſubſtantial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Being of God, and the Nothingneſs of all the Things of Time: For if Things had ſuch a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as they could like and be content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:179741:91"/> with, and could continue in it, when they like it, as long as they would, they would be always what they are: but becauſe they are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtrong enough to chuſe their Condition, nor to retain it, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in every Condition, whether Good or Evil, juſt ſo long as is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by his Pleaſure who keeps <hi>Times and Seaſons all in his own</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Acts 1. 7.</note> 
               <hi>hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, on the other ſide, the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of God muſt needs be Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Happineſs: For Eternity ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing Abſolute Being, Perfection of Being, Being with all advantage; Being and Well-being conſpire and meet in one in him, even of neceſſity. The Apoſtle, in contemplation of this, adores God, <hi>the onely Bleſſed</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 15, 16.</note> 
               <hi>and Happy Potentate;</hi> and ſubjoyns, <hi>who onely hath Immortality, and dwells in that Light to which no Man can approach.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true, Created Beings may be Immortal, and yet miſerable: that is, becauſe Created Being doth not, as Increated, reſult from it ſelf, nor is Abſolute Being; but is given, and upheld, and continued at the pleaſure
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:179741:92"/> of the Creator, and ſo receives vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of Condition, according to the Laws he hath ſet to it, while it is yet maintain'd in its Duration and Continuance; the Favour or Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God, the Righteous or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous State of it, making vaſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences herein.</p>
            <p>This then is the Eternity of God, his always alike Being, infinitely Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, infinitely Bleſſed. This is the Eternity of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt the Son</hi> of God, the Son of God eternally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, that though he <hi>proceeded</hi> and <hi>came forth from God</hi> the Father, yet he made no new Date, <hi>no Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning:</hi> Eternally begotten, without the <hi>leaſt ſhadow of turning,</hi> to denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Time, as the Creatures do by Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning; but as a Beam from the Sun, as ſoon as it is, making no new thing in the Sun; or as Apprehenſion from the Mind, as ſoon as the Mind is; or as the immediate Image and Likeneſs of the Face, as early as the Face is: thus, and infinitely more, even incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſibly, is <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Son of the Father, coeternal with him. This is the <hi>Eternity</hi> of the <hi>Son of God;</hi> but what is the <hi>Fathers Name,</hi> or <hi>what</hi>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:179741:92"/> 
               <hi>is his Sons Name in Eternity,</hi> none <note place="margin">Pro. 30. 4.</note> can tell; <hi>for who can declare his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration?</hi> but, <hi>Before all things that were made,</hi> and by being made, made a Beginning; before all things that beginning to be, caſt the ſhadow of Time; even <hi>before all things,</hi> is the <note place="margin">Col. 1. 17.</note> Saviour of the World; that is, he is <hi>Eternal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed, as <hi>he is the Son of Man,</hi> he gave great, and the greateſt Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters to Time it hath, the richeſt <hi>Aera</hi> and <hi>Epochs</hi> it hath; His Incarnation, in dating it ſelf from which, Latter Time glories and triumphs; His Death and Paſſion, his Reſurrection and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion, His Appearance <hi>the ſecond time from Heaven,</hi> to give a Period to Time. Thus, as the <hi>Son of Man,</hi> he hath enrich'd and ennobled Time: But, <hi>as the Son of God,</hi> he onely go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns Time, that is, the Things of Time, <hi>and changes Times and Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, by ſetting up, and pulling down</hi> what he pleaſes; whence Time is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly imboſs'd: but by any Change in himſelf, he doth not give the leaſt Shade of Time.</p>
            <p>The Eternity of Angels is much below this perfect, this abſolute Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:179741:93"/> for they had a Beginning, they came out of the State of Not Being, into Being: but this of Eternity they have, that their Being given them, continues for ever, laſts for ever. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed even this Duration is not by any neceſſity of Nature, as in <hi>the Son of God, the onely begotten of the Father;</hi> for he can neither have begun to be begotten, nor ceaſe to be begotten, but it muſt make a Change in God, a ſubſtantial Change. Thus alſo incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſibly ſtands the Eternity of the <hi>Divine Spirit, proceeding Eternally from the Father and the Son:</hi> But the Everlaſtingneſs of Angels hath its certainty from the Purpoſe of God unchangeable concerning it.</p>
            <p>Further, Their Eternity is not like to the Eternity <hi>of the Divine Being, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> in that as they receiv'd a Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, ſo there was a Space wherein their Condition was alterable, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the Fall of ſome, and the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally receiv'd Confirmation of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: And that it is alterable in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, may be argued by their daily increaſe in Knowledge, Additions to which Good Angels receive from the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:179741:93"/> Church, <hi>while they ſtoop down to look into the things of the Goſpel;</hi> daily Experience in both ſorts; Increaſes of Glory to the <hi>Holy miniſtring Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi> as a Reward of their Miniſtry; Aggravations of Puniſhment to the Fallen Angels, for their many and great Hoſtilities to God, his Son, and Servants: The Complement therefore of either State, is not till the Day of Judgment be paſt.</p>
            <p>Theſe things already ſpoken, lead to the Deſcription of the Eternity of the Souls of Men, conſiſting in three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That they ſhall continue for ever in Being, the unchangeable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of God upholding them in a never-ending Exiſtence.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Subſtance of their Condition ſhall never be alter'd; upon which account the Scripture often ſpeaks of a For Ever, as a Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs <hi>incorruptible,</hi> and <hi>that fadeth</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 4.</note> 
               <hi>not away;</hi> on the other ſide, of <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Puniſhment, of a Worm that never</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mat. 25. 46. Marc. 9. 44.</note> 
               <hi>dies, a Fire that is never quenched:</hi> All which ſpeak, as much as Words can convey to us, ſuch an unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able State.</p>
            <pb n="172" facs="tcp:179741:94"/>
            <p n="3"> 3. There is no Interruption or Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in the Degrees of their State; there are no Marks of Diſtinction, that theſe Souls ſhould ſay, Now more happy, now leſs happy; Now more miſerable, now leſs miſerable: But as higheſt Delight takes away all ſenſe of the Motion of Time in this Life, &amp; as ſenſe of extreme Pain makes an Hour like an Age; how much more in Eternity does the Perfection of Happineſs, and the Extremity of Miſery, the ſubſtantialneſs and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luteneſs of either State, ſwallow up all Notes of Diſtinction? God is no more Happy by any addition of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we ſuppoſe in the Duration of his Happineſs; (I ſay, we ſuppoſe) for indeed he is his own Happineſs, and his own Duration. So in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, this State is its own Duration, Heaven one intire united Moment of endleſs Delight, Hell of Miſery.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Now this State of the Souls of Men in Eternity ariſes, firſt, from the fitneſs ſuch a Nature as Mans Soul is of, that is, a Spiritual Nature, (as I have already diſcours'd) to be Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting: A Nature which God hath with Infinite Wiſdom and Power con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:179741:94"/> to be a reſemblance of himſelf. Thus the Heavens, as they are more durable, are alſo of choicer Matter, and leſs corruptible, than other Parts of the Creation: And thoſe things that by God are deſign'd for For Ever, are made ſo perfectly agreeable to their State, that they need not be altered; as if a Veſſel of pureſt Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal were made ſo ſubſtantial, that it could ſuffer no change in the Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Weight, Figure, Oriency of it, either by Fire, Hammer, or the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Accidents that fall out in length of Time; nor that there could be ſo much as a poſſible Reaſon to deſire the change of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From the Will of God, and his unchangeable Decree, that it ſhould be ſo; which he makes good and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual by continually feeding theſe Beings with Eternity; that is, from himſelf he ſends them all the Powers of Life and Motion: So that to ask, When ſhall theſe Souls, and the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral States of them, in Happineſs or Miſery, have end? is to ask, When will a Stream be dry, that is fed by a Fountain that can never be exhauſted, nor the Supply of it be poſſibly cut
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:179741:95"/> off from that Stream? His Favour is an Eternal Principle of Life and Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs; His Preſence of Wrath, and <hi>the Glory of his Power</hi> ſet againſt us, is as great a Source of Miſery and Torment. While therefore he will uphold our Beings and Faculties, and keep up their Motion, ſo long they muſt be; and while he pleaſes either to ſhine out graciouſly upon us, or to dart againſt us the Lightning of his Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſo long we muſt be either happy, or miſerable: And when either of theſe is done, to the height and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of either, as they are in the World to come, then according to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of his Will, guided with that Wiſdom by which he hath weigh'd out all things, they are to be For Ever. For the moſt Perfect of all Things now, and that are abſolutely the higheſt of his Creation, that is, Spirits; and that which is the Top of their Condition, as that to which the Laſt Judgment affixes them is, are deſign'd by God for For Ever.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The proper Exerciſes of Man's Soul, which are in Underſtanding, Righteouſneſs, Holineſs, declare the deſignment of it for Eternity. For
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:179741:95"/> theſe things being ſuch evident Beams from the Divine Glory and Being, cannot die; and thoſe Natures that have their Action plac'd in them, are thence argued Immortal. For ſeeing theſe things in themſelves, in their pure and abſtract Notions, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable; the Soul being a Seat ſo peculiarly dedicated to them, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately fitted for them, and a very Principle of them, as made by God; it is a very great preſumption of its Eternal State.</p>
            <p>There remains nothing I intend fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther touching this Vaſtneſs of Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, (concerning which, all Diſcourſe is <hi>but as the drop of the Bucket, or the ſmall duſt of the Balance; nothing, and leſs than nothing)</hi> but more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to exalt the Eternity of God, above that of his Everlaſting Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and to fall into Practical Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations upon Everlaſting Duration.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is in the firſt place certain, No Created Being hath an Eternity before Time: Of God onely, and of no Created Being, can it be ſaid, It never began, Thus it always was, It never made any new Date: <hi>From Everlaſting to Everlaſting</hi> onely <hi>God</hi>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:179741:96"/> 
               <hi>is;</hi> Of him onely it can be ſaid, <hi>He was Ever, as he is, and is to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Of no Creature can it be ſaid, abſolutely, or in regard of it ſelf, (though it be in its Everlaſting State) It muſt be, or It muſt be thus, It can be no otherwiſe: It can be onely ſaid ſo, upon account of the unchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Decree of God. There is a high agreeableneſs in the Nature of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to Be; but this, It muſt be, is onely proper to God. Of him onely to acknowledge, He may be, is (as hath been ſaid) to infold our ſelves in a poſitive Aſſurance, He is, and muſt be. He is no precarious Being; not a Being at the Free-will of any; no Chance Being; not a convenient Being onely; A Being, of which it may be ſaid, It is better, and beſt he ſhould be; though this be true, and that infinitely. But he is an Infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary Being; His Being is the Firſt, the Eternal, the Fundamental Verity.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He onely is his own Eternity: <hi>He alone lifts up his Hand to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Deut. 32. 40.</note> 
               <hi>and ſays, I live for ever;</hi> He lifts it up in the Triumph and Power of Being: All Creatures depend upon
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:179741:96"/> his Eternity; Himſelf, and his <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity are One; Himſelf is Eternity, and Eternity is himſelf.</hi> To ſpeak other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of Eternity, is onely to <hi>ſpeak as children,</hi> to ſpeak out of weak appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion to weak apprehenſion: In the <hi>Perfect State,</hi> we ſhall <hi>put away theſe childiſh things from us.</hi> A Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cannot be ſaid with propriety to be Eternal; but in a low Senſe, in a Senſe expreſſing Gods Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of himſelf. The Creature's <hi>Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting</hi> is meaſured by God's <hi>Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi> His own Being is the onely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſurable Meaſure, the unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Account of his Eternity; even as his Righteouſneſs, Truth, Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, are all Himſelf; and there are no other of theſe, but himſelf, and his Communications: Even ſo is his Eternity.</p>
            <p>Into what loweſt and moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found <note place="margin">Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on 1.</note> Adorations of the Divine Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhould the Thought of Eternity caſt us? Oh infinitely rich and ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Perfection of Being, Life, and Bleſſedneſs! What can be worthy of our Thoughts, but thy ſelf onely! What are all the Creatures of this World, compar'd with thee, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicable,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:179741:97"/> and even to be abhorr'd No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things! Why do we not always gaze with humbleſt and moſt aſtoniſhing, yet moſt delightful and raviſhing ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration upon thee! If we could ſtand near, and behold Angelical Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Heights, not as thy Servants here have done in Bodily unfitneſs, but in the Freedom of Spirits; and then compare with thy infinitely ſurmount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Glory, we ſhould even diſdain (while yet we honour and value them as thy Creatures of the higheſt Order, as <hi>Thrones and Dominions</hi> under thee) to interrupt our Adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thee, to worſhip them; and ſee what reaſon they have <hi>to cover their Faces</hi> before thee, and that thou mayeſt <hi>charge the loftieſt Seraph with Folly:</hi> Their Longeve State would ſhrink into a Moment old, comparing it with thy never-beginning Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and that Being of theirs, which compar'd with Mortality ſeems ſo ſubſtantial, would appear, if brought near to thee, but a Shadow, which thy Being caſts upon them; at the higheſt, but a Beam from thy Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour. Let our Souls never ceaſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding and contemplating thee, till
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:179741:97"/> we loſe our ſelves, and All things; till we find all again in thy moſt Bleſſed and Eternal ſelf; in <hi>thy Son, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Image of thy Eternity; in thy Spirit, eternally breathing from and resting in thy ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet let us put that Value upon our ſelves, that thou haſt put upon us, in communicating with us ſuch a Beam of thy Eternity, in making us Spirits, in reſolving us for an unchangeable, and unalterable State.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This teaches us the Vanity, Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and even Ridiculouſneſs of Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtical Scoffers, that dream thus, Why did not God create the World ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? Why did his Wiſdom, Power, Goodneſs, ſleep ſo many Ages, ere it began to manifeſt it ſelf, and make the World? As if Eternity had Soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and Later; as if that infinitely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, unbounded, changeleſs State, both backward and forward, ariſing to us immediately and neceſſarily from the conſideration of God, could be call'd to account by the Meaſures of Time. If the World had been Millions of Years older than it is, there had ſtill been an Eternity before it: A Being, with whom a <hi>thouſand years</hi>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:179741:98"/> 
               <hi>are but as yesterday, when it is paſt.</hi> Nor is there any thing more requiſite in Time, but that the Creatures of it ſhould run the Race ſet them by the Infinite Creator, and ſo fix in their unchangeable Condition.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We ſhould often reaſon with our ſelves, We are made for this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable, endleſs State; and if it be not Happineſs, how then can we endure it? this ſtable, never-altering State! We find now all Confinement, though not to Pain, but onely to one Poſture, to one Place, to one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, to one Action, tedious; this is, becauſe we find not a perfect enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Good in them: We are even weary of Pleaſures, becauſe they are but thin and ſhallow: Even of thoſe things that at the firſt we wiſh our ſelves a Perpetuity in, we afterwards grow weary, and they are tireſom to us, becauſe we come ſuddenly to all that is in them.</p>
            <p>Divine Things are burdenſom to us, becauſe, though they have end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Delights, yet our Faculties are not ſuited nor raiſed enough to them: Nay, thoſe things that are grateful to the Senſual Appetite, yet if they ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:179741:98"/> it, are not its Pleaſure, but its great Diſeaſe. O therefore how little ſhall we be able to endure one Poſture of Miſery for ever! moſt adverſe to all our Faculties, and yet they ſo rais'd and held up, as perfectly to take in and endure that Miſery; and that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery ſo extracted and ſpirituous, as to penetrate them throughout; and not coming in by Drops, and leſſer Rivu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets; but Eternity, being all alike, crowds in upon every Moment: whereas now either the Torment is dull'd and rebated, or inſtill'd and proportion'd by ſuch a Succeſſion, as carries hope of Change; or, if it be extreme, it preſently does all it can do; for it conſumes what it hath to work upon.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, How great is the Happineſs of Eternity! One ſmooth, plain, undiſturbed Bleſſedneſs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any diverſity, For Ever! The higheſt Faculties, in their perfecteſt State, gratified with higheſt Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment! Faculties ſo ſtrong, that they cannot flag; the Enjoyment ſo unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thomable, that we can never feel Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom in it! One Moment of endleſs Pleaſure! A Moment; for it hath no
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:179741:99"/> Tediouſneſs: A Moment; for it hath no Change, but is all one, and yet it is endleſs and eternal: An Eternity, the Duration of which we cannot ſo much as take notice of, being in one Ecſtaſie of Enjoyment.</p>
            <p>When we ſee miſerable Men and Women, going up and down the World, living and dying without any Obſervation, it damps the ſenſe of theſe things; and who would think, that ſuch are prepared for ſuch an unchangeable State? But how ſtrange is it, that Men hearing ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of Immortality out of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and that there is ſo much in their own Souls reſounding to it, that they are not Men concern'd to <hi>lay hold upon Eternal Life, and to fly from the Wrath that is to come!</hi> Let us look upon this great Level Ocean, that hath not ſo much as one Wave of Change riſing up in it; this huge and vaſt Champaign, ſwelling with no Hills, ſinking with no Dales.</p>
            <p>And this know, <hi>Men may go down to Hell in a moment,</hi> thinking they die, and end together: They may periſh without feeling it before-hand, or ſo much as a Conceit about it:
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:179741:99"/> But whoever are ſav'd by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they perceive themſelves Immortal; <hi>Chriſt</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 Tim. 1. 10.</note> 
               <hi>brings Life and Immortality to light in their Souls,</hi> and kindles the ſenſe of it within them; thoſe to whom he gives Eternal Life, they find this Life begin in the apprehenſions they have now of Eternity.</p>
            <p n="4">4. O how vain are thoſe trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom turmoiling Thoughts and Cares we have about Time, and the Things of it! Trundling, rolling, wheeling Time, that hath no continuance, that is ſo made on purpoſe; the Things that caſt it are ſo weak, that they are reſtleſs in their ſudden Changes. <hi>O Wheel!</hi> as it was cried out in <hi>Ezekiel:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 10. 13.</note> O changing Time, every Moment ſomething differing! Let us onely mind it, as it hath reference to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; for therein it is onely of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Eternity, that bears it up, it ſelf unconcern'd in its changeableneſs, yet receives it into it ſelf, and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows it up in it ſelf.</p>
            <p n="5">5. How neceſſary is it to change, while we may, from Sin to God? to take the advantage of Time, in the true Converſion of our ſelves to God, ſeeing Eternity endures no Change?
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:179741:100"/> To be wicked in our Eternal State, is Wickedneſs unalterable; there are no Reviews or Amendments there. To turn, is the Advantage offer'd to Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners within Time: In Eternity <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance finds no place.</hi> On the other ſide, Eternal Life is Love of God, Delight in Holineſs, without end. The Motions of Spirits in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity are ſo ſwift and perpetual one way, that there is not the leaſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to deſign a Change in: A Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is always one and the ſame, and is a Reſt, while a Motion: Even as the moſt rapid Motion of a Globe round, that is ſo ſwift and rapid, that it is not diſcern'd; and ſo even and juſt, that it looks like ſtanding ſtill. So is the State of Eternity, Action to the height, and moſt unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable.</p>
            <p>What I have hitherto diſcours'd of the Soul, hath tended chiefly to illuſtrate it in thoſe things that do immediately concern its Natural Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, or its very Being, and the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges it therein hath, as it was made in the Image of the Divine Being, and its Perfections. For, that it is an
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:179741:100"/> Inviſible Spirit, Immaterial, Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, of ſuch mighty Operations, and vehement Motions, is of immediate Relation to its Being, ſimply conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. Now theſe Excellencies of the Soul I have endeavoured ſo to abſtract, in the Diſcourſe of them, that they might appear (ſo far as is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) in their ſo abſtract and diſtinct Conſideration: and yet, as the very Thred and Nature of the Thing led me, I have taken care to follow their cloſe and inſeparable Connexion, or, (to ſpeak more truly) their perfect Union or Sameneſs with Intellect; and to obſerve the Operations to be the ſame with Intellectual and Moral Operations, that flow from an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding: To which purpoſe I have laboured in this Aſſertion, That ſuch a Being as the Soul of Man is, muſt be an Underſtanding; and ſuch Operations as thoſe proper to Mans Soul, muſt be Intellectual Operations, however clouded and obſcur'd, while in the Body.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall now addreſs my ſelf more fully to treat of the Soul, as it is this Intellectual Spirit, in its Intellectuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Intelligency it ſelf; and of its
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:179741:101"/> Intellectual and Moral Operations, wherein it is univerſally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd to be made in the Image of God: So that the former Parts of the Diſcourſe deſcrib'd, what a kind of Being, and of what exalted Motion this Intellect or Underſtanding is; and that an Intellect can be no leſs than ſuch a Being; or, no leſs a Being than ſuch a one, and of ſuch a Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, can be an Underſtanding; and that ſuch a Being, ſo moving, muſt be, can be no leſs, can be no other than an Underſtanding. What now fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, ſhall be deſign'd more cloſely to diſcover what the Intellectuality of this Great Being, and its Self-moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are; or what Underſtanding it ſelf, and the Motions of Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are. In which purſuit, I will firſt make ſome diſplay upon this great Matter, in that frequent Reſemblance of it by Light, the Scripture ſo much delights to uſe concerning it.</p>

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:179741:102"/> 
               <hi>Light of Men;</hi> He is <hi>that True Light,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">John. 1. 9.</note> 
               <hi>that inlightneth every Man that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Light then being choſen by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wiſdom, as the moſt eaſie and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar Conveyance of the Nature and Excellency of Spirits in general, as they are Intellects; and particularly, of Mans Soul, as it is an Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Let us conſider the principal Senſe and Intention, avoiding the Notices of lower and collateral Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, between Light, and the Soul of Man.</p>
            <p>That which will beſt conduct us to our main purpoſe, is the Deſcription the Apoſtle gives us of Light, <hi>That it makes manifeſt; For whatever</hi> (ſays <note place="margin">Epheſ. 5. 13.</note> he) <hi>makes manifeſt, is Light:</hi> To which our own Experience fully agrees; for we can make no Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very nor Judgment of Things, but by Light, that expounds all things to us, and is the firſt and plaineſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary upon Nature. When we therefore ſay, Man's Soul is a great Light reflected upon it ſelf, we ſpeak this Senſe.</p>
            <p>The Underſtanding of Man mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts, and lays open, and makes known
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:179741:103"/> within the Soul, and within it ſelf (for it ſelf is the Soul) whatſoever is known to the Soul; or the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of man is that, which diſcovers and diſcloſes to it ſelf all that is known to it; for thus our Saviour ſays, <hi>The light of the body is the Eye,</hi> becauſe it receives the light, and ſees by it; ſo the Underſtanding is the Eye of the Soul; and further it is its own light, ſo that it is its own Eye and its own Light; but the manner and way how this is to be underſtood, and by which the Underſtanding diſcharges this great Function, is of further enquiry.</p>
            <p>There can be no doubt of the thing it ſelf, for beſides the great proofs the Soul of man hath given hereof in thoſe many ſucceſsful Experiments it hath made in all kinds of knowledge, even thoſe that have denyed a Soul diſtinct from Body and Matter, in its Eſſence, yet cannot but acknowledge, There is ſome excellent motion in man, by which he underſtands and perceives more than <hi>the Beaſts of the Field.</hi> There is in ſome ſenſe or other <hi>A Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in man, and the breath of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty gives them underſtanding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This then being out of doubt, let
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:179741:103"/> us conſider the infinity of Divine Knowledge, and ſo attain the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Humane Underſtanding in the reſemblances of him, in whoſe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs it was made. We read of the Son of God <hi>the true Light,</hi> that <hi>he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mark 2. 8.</note> 
               <hi>in his own Spirit</hi> the thoughts of men. The Son of God, an omniſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Spirit knows all things in the light of his own Spirit, in that infinite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding eſſential to him; created Spirits, the Souls of men, having a meaſure of this perfection, a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of it, though not as Chriſt, may alſo in a degree perceive in and by their own Spirit.</p>
            <p>God then underſtands all things within himſelf, he being all Eye, all Light, able perfectly to ſee into, and comprehend all things, that either are, or are poſſible to be, or that can poſſibly ſtand in the place of Object, and all this within himſelf. For him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf being fully known to himſelf, as an infinitely ſeeing and ſelf-reflected eye; other things that are or may be, are alſo within himſelf, as the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of all Being and Motion: And as his own Underſtanding and Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance what they ſhould be, and his
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:179741:104"/> pleaſure they ſhould be what he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived them, gave them being and motion; and there is no other way of being and motion; thus and on this account, and infinitely beyond what we can conceive and expreſs, God knows what is, what is done by the virtue that is in himſelf, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally goes out of himſelf; ſo that by virtue of himſelf perfectly known to himſelf, all other things are perfectly known to himſelf alſo, <hi>Thus known to God are all his Works from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Act. 15. 18.</note> 
               <hi>of the World:</hi> Even to him who is all Eye, all Light, all Object, and before whoſe infinite eye all things ſtand preſent at once, as one ſingle point, ſo naked and open that they are all perfect ſurface and outſide, while it ſelf reſts on them.</p>
            <p>The Soul made in this Image, is in its degree Eye and Light, an intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Eye, an intellectual Light. The motions of the reaſoning contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Soul are like the motions of the Sun, an illuminating motion, light and ſparkles flye out: the openings of its faculties are like the openings of the Eye-lids of the morning, like ſome Eyes that ſee in the dark, by their
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:179741:104"/> own fire; for what can the motions of an Underſtanding, Conſcience, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, intellectual Memory be, but mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and intellectual Light? Its very ſelf is its Eye, and its motion its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened air. Thus it bears the Image of the Divine Underſtanding in its viſive power. And that it may in ſome lower degrees perceive <hi>in its own Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> we may very rationally ſuppoſe; there are ſome fundamental Ideas, ſome Images, ſome Notions or Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties pourtrayed upon, and given to the Soul, that are as ſo many rays from <hi>the Father of Lights and Truth,</hi> and make it like the Eye full of Light; and it being natural to the Soul to move it ſelf, (at leaſt aſſoon as ever it is excited by Object from without) it firſt makes a ſurvey upon things abroad, with the obſervation of which it immediately retires into it ſelf, to find what is within, and when ever the Soul thus moves through the intimacy of theſe to it, they move alſo, and reſult to the Soul; upon this their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance to the Soul, the Soul rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons about them, judges of them, and finding their cloſe connexion with it ſelf, eſtabliſhes, and ſettles them, as
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:179741:105"/> aſſured principles, of which it cannot doubt, having an immediate native power to diſcern, and approve them upon their appearance to it ſelf, and its own actuation of it ſelf upon them; and ſo they become to it in ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and enquiry foundations to build all further knowledge and aſſurance upon. By theſe the Soul takes its meaſures, and finds out the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of things at further diſtances from it, and reduces them under its own cogniſance and juriſdiction; it makes its ſearches into thoſe Objects that ſtrike it from without, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thoſe Teſts of Truth it hath within; and theſe are the <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> ſo much ſpoken of in ſpeculation or ſcience, and in things that pertain to practice, and that <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>that Law written in the Heart, the Law of</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 2. 14, 15.</note> 
               <hi>Nature,</hi> the Soul hereby becoming a <hi>Law to it ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Soul then encompaſſed with theſe Beams trys all things in the <hi>Light of its own Countenance,</hi> and judges of them there, in ſome lower propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of likeneſs to God; I ſay in ſome lower proportions, for whereas the Divine Underſtanding comprehends
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:179741:105"/> all things within it ſelf, in the Souls of men we do not ſuppoſe theſe Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to extend further, than to thoſe things that do intimately concern the perfection and happineſs of mans Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, being either ſuch as do immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately fit it for the enjoyment of God, the true eſtimation of, and care for it ſelf, the Duties of intrinſick goodneſs towards men; or are the neceſſary foundations of all Knowledge, and ſo prepare it for intellectual advances. So that as to the perfection of Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty pertains Omniſciency, reſulting from his Nature or Univerſal Being; ſo to the perfection of mans Being is required a Science, though of a much narrower ſphere than Gods; even as the Being of Man is infinitely narrower than the Being of God.</p>
            <p>And although it be allowed to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Underſtanding to examine and ſearch into all other things, that are beyond the Confines of it ſelf, yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to it by God, either in his Word or Works, and to aſpire to ſome imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Knowledge of God, it can notwithſtanding do it only by pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits of Reaſon, knitting one princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to another, and deriving one thing
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:179741:106"/> from another, and all this in a way of treaty with the things, and reflecting them within that great mirror of it ſelf, to it ſelf, and ſo underſtanding them as far as it can; not as God, who ſees all things as in one view, and within himſelf, yet to the perfection of Knowledge, even to the utmoſt that things can be known.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place, Although I cannot ſee, how the Soul can judge of things without ſuch a ſtandard, ſuch a principle, connatural to it, by which it may examine all things, if there be not ſomething within, that anſwers to the offertures from without; and what can that be ſo well, as certain hidden Characters of Truth, created with the Soul, that immediately leap up at the firſt ſalutation of Things from abroad, and do more plainly diſcover themſelves upon farther Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? Yet if any will allow no more, than a power of diſcerning and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of things, of which I have already ſpoken, and will have it, that all the Soul hath to work by is this only, and all it hath to work upon are the Objects offered from without to it by ſenſe; from which it receives in all
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:179741:106"/> appearances, and by its motions upon them ſearches and finds out their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and ſtays the Images of them in it ſelf, as Senſe hath taken them, till it can underſtand them; we will not diſpute, but ſuppoſe, that as God brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Adam</hi> the ſeveral Creatures to ſee what he would call them, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in recommending them to that Soul he had ſo newly breathed from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that, in that yet unſtained and unſullied Light, they might be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerned and pronounced of; ſo are the ſeveral things in the world firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the Senſes, and by them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended from hand to hand, till they are brought into the very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Soul, and there, though not with that ſpeed, eaſe, clearneſs, and certainty, as at firſt, yet are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, comprehended, and judged of by it; and from this conſidering and underſtanding things ariſe ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſome ſtandard principles of Truth, which being ſettled, advance it in its aſpirings to further knowledge and notices of Things.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Soul is a great Receptacle of all that Light, that is offered to it from without, it is prepared in its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:179741:107"/> to be kindled and illuſtrated by all Rational Propoſes, either from God the higheſt Underſtanding, from Angels by Divine Appointment, from repreſentations of Reaſon, propoſed by one man to another, either by ſpeaking or writing; ſo that all the Knowledge former Ages have derived upon theſe that come after, and all the Monuments of Learning that have been ſet in any time or part of the World, and the mutual Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation that Learned men have one with another, increaſe this Light: Thus the Underſtandings of men are as ſo many Torches enlightening and enflaming one another.</p>
            <p>This way of exciting Reaſon and Underſtanding to its proper motion, and action, and ſo heightening it to its native ſplendour, ſeems the moſt plain, general, and experimental: and though all ſuch addreſſes ſuppoſe that inward power and virtue of the mind, and by their ſucceſs prove there is ſuch a one; yet it muſt be confeſſed, the Underſtanding of Man does common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lye dead, till it be in this manner raiſed: And therefore it may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, that the great Learning
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:179741:107"/> and Knowledge that is in the World, hath been at firſt by inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or inward repreſentation from God to Mans Soul, and from Men ſo inſtructed to thoſe that have received from them by the ſame way of diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and inſtruction.</p>
            <p>Yet this derogates no farther from the inward and native power of Mans Soul, than to acknowledge that the motions of it are ſuppreſſed by Bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſtruction, and ſlumbred by that ignorance which is fallen as an unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural dimneſs upon it, degrading it becauſe of ſin, from which it is yet vindicated by earneſt and vehement ſtirring it ſelf; but this dimneſs is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo accompanied with a lothneſs to ſtir at all, or at leaſt not with ſuch an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs as is neceſſary, except it be ſome way incited, awakened, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged; and the moſt uſual and fit way is that of Inſtruction; which doth at the ſame time lay together the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and almoſt buried ſparks, and alſo blow them up into a light flame; for which reaſon we commit the minds of Children early to Maſters and Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, who may draw out and ſharpen this Underſtanding. And yet to ſhew
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:179741:108"/> Underſtanding hath its force from it ſelf, and not from Inſtruction, Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are often exceeded by thoſe whom they have taught. Sometimes Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is but a ſhort hint or intimation to the Soul, quick of apprehenſion, that preſently enlarges much further upon it; and many Inſtances there are of thoſe, who have cut their own way to Knowledge, and ſuch a one as hath been altogether untrodden be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. Notwithſtanding this, the advantage of Inſtruction is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and moſt evident in that part of Knowledge, which concerns us to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, the Knowledge of his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Intentions towards us, and our Duty to him; wherein Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation hath been always the firſt, and is ever the moſt ſure and undoubted Guide.</p>
            <p>Yet even in this <hi>the Spirit of Man is the Candle of the Lord:</hi> For God doth not, that he may make known himſelf, create any new Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but applies himſelf in Grace to his firſt Creation, the Soul of Man, of which there is no abolition by Divine Illumination; but, as the Scripture ſpeaks of the Sun, <hi>the Light of it</hi>
               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:179741:108"/> 
               <hi>grows ſeven-fold:</hi> The Candle that burnt dim, and was even choak'd up, is trimm'd, and becomes Light on all ſides, and ſends out its Beams from every part.</p>
            <p>The Sum then is this: The Soul of Man is the ſame Candle of the Lord, whoſe Natural Power of Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is rais'd and made more clear by the Irradiation of Inſtruction, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Power be an innate Force of Trying and Judging of Things by it ſelf, as it is a Faculty able to try and judge by the Nature of its Being, or by ſome implanted Sentiments given to it with its Being, or by Maxims to be collected by it ſelf through the miniſtery and mediation of Senſe.</p>
            <p>However theſe things be, it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways of the Nature of Underſtanding, that there be a Reſentment and Feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the agreeableneſs of Truth to it ſelf: There muſt be a Knowing in its own Spirit, by every Intelligence, the Reaſonableneſs and Verity of the Things propos'd, or there can be no Underſtanding.</p>
            <p>Even Faith it ſelf is an Intellectual, that is, an Explicite, not an Implicite Act; elſe it would be but a meer
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:179741:109"/> childiſh Memory of what hath been receiv'd, as Catechiſm: But all true Acts of Underſtanding have a Taſte and Reliſh; and what is propos'd to Mind, muſt have a Guſtfulneſs to it: Knowledge and Faith not at all dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering in this, but onely that in things of Knowledge, the Underſtanding ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives at that Knowledge, or at leaſt acquieſces in it, upon Grounds more its own; in things of Faith, by Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances more out of it ſelf, yet having Inſtruments of its own for the accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch, when ſo offer'd; Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters and Teſts within it ſelf, of what is offer'd, whether it be worthy to be believ'd; Reſentments within it ſelf of Pleaſure or Trouble, according to the Quality of what it hath receiv'd, when ſo offer'd.</p>
            <p>To draw all this that hath been ſpoken, to what is mainly to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that is, That the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is the Candle of the Lord, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially lighting us to himſelf: Let us therefore inquire after ſome Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples that are Standards in the great Concernments we have with God; which whether they are ſettled in the Soul by the Hand that created it, or
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:179741:109"/> do immediately reſult from the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of Things without, impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Mind, running through its own Circuits and Trains of Reaſon concerning them; or whether it is led into them by the Inſtructions God is ſtill giving into the World; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all theſe concur to their eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the heart of Man; yet they are ſuch, as are univerſally conſented in, and are the Foundation of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Practice, and alſo ſuch a Recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle for ſupernatural Revelation, that there it may be taſted, acknowledged, and ſavoured as Divine; with theſe, as with a <hi>Helm, the great Governour of Spirits turns them whither ſoever he liſteth,</hi> either for Conviction or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, Repentance and Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; or (as he pleaſes) to Self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation: And all the boiſterouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their contrary affections are overrul'd and controll'd hereby. Such Principles I eſteem theſe Four.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Princip. </seg>1</label> That there is a God: The Soul can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not move, but it acknowledges God; a Soul cannot look up, but it ſees God; and this Principle in the Soul is a great Light: God hath ſo carved himſelf into Underſtanding, that there cannot
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:179741:110"/> be an Underſtanding in Motion and Activity, but there muſt be a ſight, a conception, an apprehenſion of ſuch a Being as God; as the Eye cannot open, but it ſees the Light; or if it ſeems to lye hid, yet upon the leaſt colliſion, as between the Flint and Steel, upon any conflict of Thought with it ſelf, or with the Propoſe of this Truth from without, this Light breaks forth: <hi>It is manifeſt in men, becauſe God hath ſhewed it to them;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 19.</note> that is, In the very making them Souls he hath ſet it in them: In the firſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn action of the Underſtanding, the acknowledgment of a Supreme Being rebounds and leaps up to them; the Soul no ſooner ſees any thing by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſenſe, but it ſees God the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, as a Man that ſees the impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Wax preſently thinks of the Seal: Many Men endeavour to reject and diſannul this Principle, but they cannot deface it, much leſs wear out the apprehenſion. And when the Soul hath conſidered further, and more ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently, the more it reaſons, the more it confirms, and ſettles it ſelf in the aſſurance of the Divine Being; even when it endeavours to Reaſon
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:179741:110"/> out this Belief of it, it prevails the more: And beſides what it hath with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in concerning God, <hi>The inviſible Things</hi> 
               <note place="margin">V. 20.</note> 
               <hi>of him from the Creation of the World are clearly ſeen, being underſtood by the Things that are made and done; even his eternal Power and Godhead.</hi> So that the Soul can neither conſider without nor within but it ſees God.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Princip. </seg>2:</label> That we have a Soul: Many have violently oppreſſed this Senſe, thus far, as to deny a Soul, a Spirit, diſtinct in its Eſſence; yet they cannot but acknowledge a vehemency of Motion, an Activity <hi>that teaches us more than the Beaſts of the Field:</hi> Every man muſt ſay, <hi>There is a Spirit in Man above any other Creature,</hi> a force and excellency of Motion, the Motion of Reaſon and Underſtanding: No Man can ſtir, but he finds, <hi>There is a Breath of the Almighty that gives him <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now theſe two Principles, as they do mutually enlighten one another, ſo they give great and illuſtrious light to all holy Practice; they enlighten themſelves; for he that apprehends a God, whoſe very Being is abſolute Perfection, retires out of all things
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:179741:111"/> bodily and weak, to conceive aright of him, and find him out; and when he is thus underſtood, the Notion of an inferiour and ſubordinate Spirit that yet hath a likeneſs to him, is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie: And whoever finds out in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a diviner part than Body, hath an eaſie aſcent to God, in whom all the leſſer Perfections of his own Being are tranſcended, and at the height. And how do they both ſhine upon holy Practice, ſeeing God is the great both Exemplar and Argument of all Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs! And no Man can ſuppoſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to have received ſuch great pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Underſtanding for mean, much leſs unworthy ends, but that he ſhould be holy, and like God by them.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Princip. </seg>3</label> The excellency of Holineſs and true Goodneſs, and the Evil of Sin and Vice are immediately felt by the Soul: A diſtinction between Good and Evil is the next thing to an Underſtanding; and hereupon excuſing Apologies and Accuſations are tranſacted within the Soul, concerning all our actions.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Princip. </seg>4</label> An after ſtate of Reward or Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment: All theſe the Soul hath ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry near it, and though it may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed by contrary pretences, yet
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:179741:111"/> the Images of theſe can never be wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped out, but even when it ſeems to be perſwaded otherwiſe, yet it is ſtill encountred with theſe appearances: The Soul is ſo imprinted with theſe Notions, that it can never look into it ſelf, but it finds them, <hi>and they are the very light of its Countenance,</hi> which it cannot but ſee, and ſee by, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it acts it ſelf.</p>
            <p>And by theſe Principles, either created with Man, or further commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to him, he tryes and ſearches, and is able to diſcern the things offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him by God; for I am fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, there is no greater tryal, nor aſſurance of Revelation, than the Principles of Natural Religion, clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and confirmed by that Revelation, giving a laſting and ſetled aſſurance to the mind in its cooleſt and moſt quiet debates, after it hath been alarmed, and approached by Miracles.</p>
            <p>By theſe a Man is able to move yet further, into the concatenations and connexions of Truth with Truth, and judges by them, as a Touch-ſtone within it ſelf; and being aided and aſſiſted by the Spirit of God, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Man becomes a much higher
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:179741:112"/> Light: For by that higher illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Supreme Light, the Spirit of God, <hi>It judges</hi> (as the Apoſtle <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 15.</note> ſays) <hi>all things;</hi> ſearches into all points of Knowledge, tryes and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines, determines and pronounces of every Thing propoſed to it either by God or Men; <hi>Yet it ſelf is judged by no Man;</hi> that is, No Man is able to give a clear and perfect account of it in this life, either in its Nature as a Spirit, or its gracious ſtate, as renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Spirit of God. But in Eternity, this Lamp, thus enlightened by Grace, ſhall perfectly ſhine out and break forth; It ſhall be as the Stars of the Firmament, full of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Glory and moſt comfortable Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: <hi>They that be wiſe, ſhall ſhine</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Dan. 12. 3.</note> 
               <hi>as the Firmament and Stars, and as the Sun;</hi> that is, This Lamp ſhall ſhine out with all the addition of Light and Luſtre, Oriency and Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, both of Knowledge and Purity, Glory and Happineſs. If it be not thus; it will be as a Fire-brand, as a Furnace of enraged Fire, as a flaming Torch tormented with its own Light, and tortured without end in its own Flame.</p>
            <pb n="209" facs="tcp:179741:112"/>
            <p>For this Light of the Soul is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Light of Heaven; it is a Light that is Divine, and can never be put out; It is a Beam of that Light, and cannot be quenched. The Soul in its own Eſſence is a Spark from Heaven, like the Light of a Diamond, a ſubſtance ſo ſolid, that it cannot corrupt nor moulder. The Light of Truth ſhining in theſe Principles is Divine, and of Eternal Truth: Theſe with their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences are always true; even as thoſe acknowledged Principles of Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which all Underſtandings do, and muſt acknowledge.</p>
            <p>The Soul then being a Light ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable, (more laſting than thoſe Lamps of ancient Times, that have been found burning many Ages after) and the Principles of Truth inlaid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to its very Eſſence, being as laſting as it; there muſt be ever a luſtre of Glory and Happineſs about it, or a Blaze of Torment, according to the ſenſe the Soul hath of its friendſhip with God, and the Light he hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened it with, or the enmity and reſiſtance it hath made thereunto; for accordingly this Light is again friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the God of it gracious to the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:179741:113"/> Soul; and, in the juſt indignation of that God, the Light alſo, ſeeing it can neither be friendly nor extinguiſhed, muſt needs vex and amaze, like an angry Light that ſcorches and dazles together.</p>
            <p>Thus I have diſcovered the firſt part, That the Soul is a Light. The ſecond part is, That this Light is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected; <hi>It is the Candle of the Lord, ſearching the innermoſt parts of the Belly;</hi> that is, Turning it ſelf inward upon all the ſecrets and retirements of a Man.</p>
            <p>This Light is a Light not only ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning forward, and looking into things without, but ſhining backward, and looking upon it ſelf: So far as the Soul goes back, ſo far this Light goes back upon, and into it ſelf.</p>
            <p>The Soul may be reſembled to <hi>that Breaſt-plate of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim and Thummim,</hi> upon <hi>Aarons Heart;</hi> the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim,</hi> as Lights, diſcerning Things abroad; and the <hi>Thummim,</hi> as perfection or ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, judging the goodneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of it ſelf.</p>
            <p>This Light is not only reciprocated with it ſelf, after the manner of an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, but after the manner of a Conſcience.</p>
            <pb n="211" facs="tcp:179741:113"/>
            <p>Both ways it differs from the Sun and Stars; they ſhine, but they do not know upon what they ſhine, they bring home no light or obſervation, concerning all thoſe things upon which they ſhine: Herein the Soul differs as an Underſtanding; for it confers with it ſelf concerning all things, upon which its Light ſhines.</p>
            <p>Again, The Sun and Stars they ſhine, but do not know they ſhine, nor can reflect upon themſelves, as ſuch Bodies of Light and Glory; nor can they at all judge of themſelves, or what they do, how glorious they are, or what ſpots are upon them, when they are ſhadowed or eclipſed, or when they ſhine in their full Luſtre: Herein they differ from the Soul, as a Conſcience.</p>
            <p>The Soul knows it knows, as well as what it knows, it cannot but know and feel it knows, and is eſpecially knowing of it ſelf, and its own Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: Thus it excels Natural Light, yet Light gives ſome reſemblance hereof; Light comes into a Room, it comes in at one end of the Room and leaps to the other, it leaps back again, and ſhines in its own face: The Soul
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:179741:114"/> is this through-light, which meets it ſelf, and reciprocates with it ſelf, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circles it ſelf within it ſelf. This is the Soul which ſhines upon, and back, into and within, and round about it ſelf.</p>
            <p>As to inſtance firſt in the Light of Direction it gives: It knows that it knows what is to be done. When the Soul hath ſhined to it ſelf concerning doing good, and avoiding ſin, it knows it hath done ſo; and God will challenge men upon their own Knowledge, and they will never be able to deny their Knowledge: No man can deny his Knowledge to God, or to himſelf, even as a man cannot deny his Knowledge to another man, that knows his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge together with him; much leſs to God, or to himſelf, who are ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly acquainted with him, and all his ways: For the Soul in all caſes is made to ſhine in its own Face, and the ſecrets of it are in <hi>the greater Light of Gods Countenance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. For Conviction of what a man is and hath done: Every man muſt confeſs, and cannot deny his own Actions; a man muſt confeſs, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny his own Actions to himſelf, nor a general Character of himſelf to
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:179741:114"/> himſelf; every man is accuſed or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by his own Knowledge: Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man knows his own ſincerity, good intention, good action, and is conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of the contrary: Hence the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation and the horrour a man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives within himſelf, and ſo the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and joy of a man, is clear and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; <hi>The heart knows its own ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Prov. 14. 10.</note> 
               <hi>and its own joy, and a ſtranger cannot intermeddle with either,</hi> he cannot interpoſe againſt the judgment of the Soul upon it ſelf; <hi>This is our</hi>

               <note place="margin">Galat. 6. 4.</note> 
               <hi>his own work, and hath rejoycing in his own good ſenſe of himſelf,</hi> or trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in his own Cenſure, and not in that of another.</p>
            <p>As a man knows, and finds himſelf in himſelf, in a natural ſenſe; ſo in a moral, <hi>The Spirit of a Man knows the things that are within him.</hi> We may ſay in this caſe, as in things of ſecrecy, I know what I know; and as in things of certainty, what I know I know.</p>
            <p>The ſum is this: In things that are under direction, no man can refuſe, deny, or reſiſt the preſence of his own Knowledge, in what he does know,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:179741:115"/> any more than he can reſiſt the day, <hi>To him therefore that knows it is ſin,</hi> and commits it, or good, and omits it, to him <hi>it is ſin</hi> of a deep dye.</p>
            <p>In things of ſentence and judgment upon a mans ſelf, if a mans heart con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns him, <hi>God is greater than his Heart.</hi> His Knowledge and purity are greater, and therefore condemns him more; but yet God knows a man together with his heart, and condemns him together with it, and moſt of all within it: <hi>If a mans heart condemn</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 20, 21.</note> 
               <hi>him not, he hath confidence,</hi> and juſt ground of it, <hi>towards God;</hi> becauſe the <hi>very witneſs</hi> of a mans heart con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him is <hi>true and is no lye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There may be ſome very particular caſes, in which a man may be ſo clowded, as to deem more ſeverely of himſelf, than his ſtate deſerves; and there may be ſome dreams, in which a man fancies himſelf better, than he is; but not ſuch as deſerve to abate from this general account of mans Soul; for theſe miſtakes are but tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary, and by cloſe attention it may vindicate it ſelf from them.</p>
            <p>But the great objection againſt the Soul being ſuch a Light, is this:</p>
            <pb n="215" facs="tcp:179741:115"/>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
               </label> If the Soul of man be ſuch <hi>a Candle of the Lord,</hi> how comes it to paſs, that men are ſo ignorant of things, and of themſelves?</p>
            <p n="1">
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
               </label> 1. Theſe things are to be diſcourſed according to their own Truth, their firſt Nature and Conſtitution: Now the Soul of Man was created ſo; and it is ſtill ſo in its own Nature; though there are many accidental Coverings and Obſcurings of it in Men; as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Light of the Sun hath grown pale and wan, and the ſhinings of it withdrawn.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There fell indeed a great dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs upon this Light by the ſin of Man, and there need Lights from without, and much Exerciſe from within, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it; ſo in great Judgments, <hi>the Sun hath been turned into Sackcloth, and the Moon into Blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. There is much to be attributed to its preſent ſtate, as thruſt down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a groſs Body, where it is covered, like a Diamond incloſed in Clay, or like thoſe Lamps that burnt in Vaults, and under ground.</p>
            <p n="4">4. How much is to be imputed to thoſe Steams and Vapours of Luſt, and Fogs of Senſual Appetite, that riſe
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:179741:116"/> up and obſcure the Soul, like the Sun in a Cloud or Miſt?</p>
            <p n="5">5. There is a freedom of the Soul and Underſtanding, like that of the Eye, though ſome things dart in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, that it muſt ſee; and though turning it ſelf every way, it muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſee what it would not ſee; yet it can endeavour, and in part effect the turning it ſelf, from the obſervation of things moſt proper to it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider thoſe that pertain only to the preſent life, whither with all its vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency it carries its Light.</p>
            <p>But laſtly, and eſpecially: There is much more a Man knows of himſelf, and Things, than he ſeems to know. How many things that are not found, nor can be drawn into the diſcourſe of ſome ignorant men, much leſs into their practice, that yet, when you tell them of, they receive not as things they never knew, but only as ſuch they have not dealt with, or uſually converſed with; and upon more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table occaſions, they break out from them, in whom they were not ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have a place.</p>
            <p>And concerning men themſelves, though in their careleſs demeanour
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:179741:116"/> towards themſelves, they flatter their own hearts, and do not bring their full Eye and Light upon themſelves; yet they have a ſecret notice of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, a private mark of their own condition; which, they know, is much more true, than that forced or falſe Opinion they endeavour to breed and nurſe up of themſelves.</p>
            <p>In ſum therefore; I think the moſt ignorant man hath this Light in his Soul, however covered; he hath it, though it doth not outwardly ſhew it ſelf, but lyes ſtill now, as it doth in Children, without the notable diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of what it notwithſtanding tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is, and will one day appear to be.</p>
            <p>We ſhould all therefore ſeriouſly conſider what we are, what Souls we have: There is ſuch a Lamp in us, though it be but as under a Bed or Buſhel. As it is moſt neceſſary to conſider, what Duſt we are in our Bodies, ſo to apprehend what Spirit we are in our Souls; it is a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of wiſdom to know the frail con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of our Mortality, but it is a far greater to know the Immortality of our Souls. As Princes in their Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and in whom Mortality was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:179741:117"/> to the higheſt, were admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by Remembrancers choſen on purpoſe, that they were of the ſame Clay with other men, capable of the ſame Corruption, Diſeaſe, Death; ſo they that carry their Souls loweſt, ſhould be put in mind by Men of greateſt Underſtanding, Piety, ſere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Conſcience, and others of quickeſt Anguiſh, and trouble of mind, what Souls they have. Every man may ſee in them what themſelves are, and that thoſe Spirits within them will be at laſt either ſhining Suns, or flaming Torches For ever: For in Eternity God will certainly call out all Souls to their Office and Function in Light; whether it be to Life and Happineſs, or to Condemnation and Miſery.</p>
            <p>How great is the Mercy then, when God calls out and uncovers this Light now, and puts it into Motion, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightens it far higher, with the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of himſelf in Chriſt; ſo making it directive, conſolatory, healing light, <hi>from the healing wings of the Sun of Righteouſneſs,</hi> ſo making us <hi>Lights Burning, Burning and Shining Lights</hi> in his Light, which always makes happy.</p>
            <pb n="219" facs="tcp:179741:117"/>
            <p>Let us continually aſcend to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Lights in <hi>Chriſt, That Light,</hi> that we may be <hi>Seraphims</hi> dwelling in that Everlaſting Light, and Love, wherein God and Chriſt inhabit.</p>
            <p>Let us fear, though this Light ſhall indeed always burn, yet leſt it burn black, leſt it caſt the Darkneſs of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery in the midſt of Knowledge, and the Blackneſs of utter Diſconſolate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, while it blazes with conviction; that we become not <hi>wandring bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Stars,</hi> full of the Light of convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but which turns us out as Fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives from God, and our ſelves, <hi>like Cain</hi> having no peace, no reſt in our Knowledge; <hi>Wandring Stars, for whom is reſerved the blackneſs of darkneſs, For Ever.</hi> For ſo as this Candle of the Lord ſhall burn, ſuch as this Light is, holy and comfortable, or condemning and tormenting; ſo ſhall our ſtate be, and that to Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting.</p>
            <p>I am now come down as low in the Deſcription I firſt gave of the Soul, as to ſpeak of it as it is the Source and Fountain of all the Actions of a man; for ſo it is, whether they are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural or moral.</p>
            <pb n="220" facs="tcp:179741:118"/>
            <p>And as for natural, It is the moſt eaſie deſcription of the Soul to ſay, it is the Author of them; even as when we would deſcribe God with greateſt eaſineſs to be underſtood, we call him the Creator of Heaven and Earth, the Preſerver of all things; <hi>that gives to all their Being, Breath, and Motion;</hi> ſo we underſtand the Soul with leaſt difficulty, when we ſpeak of it, as that which guides, and conducts, and gives ſpirit to all the motions of Body, all the powers of that; That which a lower Soul doth in Beaſts, that the higher doth in Man, but in a more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble way.</p>
            <p>For when God made <hi>Adam,</hi> and formed him of Earth, and prepared all the Inſtruments of Motion and Action in the Body; when this excellent and curious Machine lay dead before him, he <hi>breathed</hi> into it the Soul, to ſtir and move it, and to carry all the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it.</p>
            <p>Or as a Muſicians Inſtrument, exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made and ſtrung, the Muſicians Art comes as a Soul upon it; ſtirs it, and tunes the ſound of it, and then ſtrikes it into Harmony and Melody: The firſt Body given to Man, was
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:179741:118"/> 
               <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a Body ſubſiſting, acted by a Soul; as the Body given in the Reſurrection is called <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a Body that ſhall ſubſiſt and be acted by a Spirit, that is, A Soul at the higheſt exaltation.</p>
            <p>What is that then, that ſees in the Eyes? That hears in the Ears? That touches in the Hand, and feels in the whole Body? This is no other than the Soul, and it does all this with the ſuperiority of a Rational Agent, much otherwiſe than the Soul of a Beaſt can do: for there is a vein of Reaſon and Underſtanding, that is, Rational Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, directions to Rational ends, running along in the Souls acting the Body.</p>
            <p>When this Soul leaves this Body, though all the Inſtruments remain, yet the power ceaſes.</p>
            <p>But of this I will no further enquire, becauſe it is not to the main pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place, As we riſe higher concerning God, we expreſs him an Infinite Wiſdom and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; an Infinite Juſtice and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; a Holineſs and Purity unſpotted, governing the World in Righteouſneſs
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:179741:119"/> and Truth, and exerciſing compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in it, which are nearer approaches to the Being of God; ſo hath the Soul Powers of its own, Senſes, and Affections, that cloſely deſcribe it.</p>
            <p>What is it that Underſtands? That Reaſons? That deſigns and contrives? Whence are the Notions of Right and Wrong, Good and Evil, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Tendencies and Operations ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way? Whence are rational and moral Joys? Deſires and Delights? Whence are intellectual Sorrows and Complaints? All theſe are evidently and apparently from ſuch a Spring, as the Soul, and to theſe it is we muſt now attend; and that we may do it with better advantage, let us obſerve that Oracle of <hi>Solomon,</hi> given us in the way of Counſel: <hi>Keep thy heart with all Diligence, for out of it are</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Prov. 4. 23.</note> 
               <hi>the Iſſues of Life: viz.</hi> Thoſe lively Motions and Actions, wherein the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar life of a Man is diſcovered, and which tend if ſteered, and directed aright, to endleſs life.</p>
            <p>To diſcourſe hereof, I muſt again reflect upon the Spirit of a Man, the Candle of the Lord, in regard of whoſe Light it is ſaid to Man, <hi>Keep</hi>
               <pb n="223" facs="tcp:179741:119"/> 
               <hi>thy Heart;</hi> for it is more than if the Heart of Man were only bidden to keep it ſelf: But to this higher act of the Spirit of Man are all the directions of the Word of God addreſſed, that it would bear up it ſelf, and control all the lower Motions of the Soul. This therefore I conclude upon, That from the Spirit of a man, as it is the Candle of the Lord, ſhines a Ray, that is by God preſerved according to its Nature, diſtinct from all the Intereſt and Intrigues of the Soul, as it is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, that it may always bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to himſelf, and be a <hi>Law within a Man;</hi> being not only a Witneſs and a Judge, but a Receiver of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Diſpleaſure in the notices of it, and an Executioner of it upon the Soul; and ſo in Men finally rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and diſobedient, it becomes an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of puniſhment.</p>
            <p>And this Light it is a certain neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, and immediate act of an Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that cannot but be always the ſame, that can never be altered, it being always for God and Goodneſs againſt Sin, and the very Sinner in whom it dwells, and muſt and will be the ſame, even in Hell it ſelf,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:179741:120"/> where <hi>the Devils believe and tremble,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Jam. 2. 19.</note> and know they are juſtly puniſhed.</p>
            <p>For as the Sun looking upon things moſt impure, always declares and diſcovers them, as they are, and can do no otherwiſe; thus <hi>the Candle of the Lord</hi> cannot but lay open all the foulneſs that is in a Man; all the love a Man hath to himſelf, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion of his own Being, cannot bribe it: All the rage againſt God and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs that is in Hell, can never alter this; elſe the ſting of guilt, and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of conſcience, ſo great a part of Hell, would be taken away.</p>
            <p>The Light of the Soul, as we have before diſcourſed, is the higheſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector of a Man to all that is good, and is ever ready to be conſulted with; if the Good it propoſes be embraced, it rejoyces in it, applauds, praiſes, and congratulates the Soul, and derives joy, pleaſure, and happineſs upon it: But if that Good be not embraced, or the contrary Evil entertained, which is diſſwaded; it then chides, upbraids, and afflicts a man; and if there be no Repentance, it extremely afflicts, and afflicts for ever, enforcing ſelf-abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and condemnation upon the Soul.</p>
            <pb n="225" facs="tcp:179741:120"/>
            <p>And this untainted part, which is no other, but the pure reſult of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and true Underſtanding, is always in Glory, applauding the Juſtice of God againſt the ſinful Soul, in which it lives, and is the very inſtrument of Miſery upon it, as depraved; for this Light being but a ſingle Act of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and not obeyed, but a ſolitary Verdict of the Mind, from which the reſt diſſent, it can derive no happineſs upon the Soul, but on the contrary anguiſh and affliction.</p>
            <p>This being then preconſidered, let us now more preſſingly ſearch the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Mans Soul, as it is in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſtiled, <hi>The Heart;</hi> and <hi>the Heart out of which are the Iſſues of Life;</hi> firſt drawing the powers of Reaſon themſelves, and their motions, and then ſhewing them, as they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, (for ſo they are always) into one of thoſe two Channels, Good or Evil.</p>
            <p>In the Heart then are all the powers of Motion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Here is the immediate directive Underſtanding or Judgment, which determines to Action; and this is a different thing from the Light of <hi>the</hi>
               <pb n="226" facs="tcp:179741:121"/> 
               <hi>Candle of the Lord,</hi> which is always the ſame; for this may be debaſed and corrupted; it may mix it ſelf with lower Conſiderations; and in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of Men it does ſo, even to the eclipſing and darkening the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Light, not in it ſelf, but in its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency and brightneſs upon the Soul; as the Sun is the ſame, although its Light may be ſhadowed from us.</p>
            <p>But this practical Underſtanding, however it may be corrupted, yet hath the more immediate conduct of all the actions, and contains in it ſelf the Guſt, Taſte, and Motion of the whole Soul, and immediately fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runs Action; for it determines things with their Circumſtances, it ballan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces diviner Reaſons and Temptations on the contrary part together; the Love and Fear of God on one ſide, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticements from Fleſh, and Blood, and the World on the other.</p>
            <p>Now there is a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two; It is beſt to be holy and virtuous in it ſelf, and in general; and, It is beſt for me in particular, and in this particular Action to be holy: Between theſe two; An Act of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as it reſides in the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:179741:121"/> and an Act of Judgment, as it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines the whole Soul, Motion and Action unto it.</p>
            <p>This very practical Underſtanding is in Scripture called <hi>The Heart, Let</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Prov. 23. 15.</note> 
               <hi>thy Heart be wiſe:</hi> It is this Wiſdom of the Heart that denotes a man Good; not that moſt clear Light that ſhines from above, and down upon the Heart, not within it, but ſo without it, that it doth not reſide in it, and change it into it ſelf.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Here are the Will and Affections, which are the reſolution, vehemency, and keenneſs of the Judgment, and carry the notion of the neareſt and next Powers of Action.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Here is the Memory preſenting anew the Images of Things paſt, and offering what hath been obſerved of them heretofore, either as to their chuſeableneſs or undeſervingneſs: Here is the Imagination diſplaying things new and old; and ſo diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, that in things of leſſer im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, their appearance is greater than themſelves; in Things of trueſt, and greateſt Importance, by the help of Imagination well imprinted, they come nearer to their own greatneſs,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:179741:122"/> and appear much greater than they would do elſe; which is the great benefit of ſanctified Imagination: in regard of which <hi>David</hi> prays, <hi>That God would keep it always in the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Chron. 29. 18.</note> 
               <hi>of the people, to fear the Lord, and keep his Laws.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Here is the reſort of all outward Objects, with their ſeveral Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of Commendation or Diſpraiſe; as Embaſſies in the Court of a Prince, ſo are the ſeveral Propoſes made, and addreſſed here, from thoſe ſeveral Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions; the Region above, which makes Offertures of greateſt Happineſs; and the Region below, which ſends alſo the glozed Tenders of Good.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Here are the Habits riſing up by the degrees of propenſions, inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, temper, and readineſs to Action, till by repeated Action they are ſo ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled, that they become <hi>the Treaſure of the Heart,</hi> out of which it freely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends <note place="margin">Mat. 12. 35.</note> every moment, and at a minutes warning, as occaſion calls it out.</p>
            <p>And from all theſe ariſe reſtleſs mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, moves, and removes of the Soul it ſelf, and of the Things within it ſelf, about which it treats; endleſs Thoughts, Imaginations, Remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:179741:122"/> Willings, Hatings, Deſirings, Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, and Abhorrencies; and theſe in infinite mazes cutting one another: ſome weaving one with another, and mutually ſtrengthening themſelves; others contracting cool, and ſuſpend the Soul to either part; ſometimes the Prints that have prevailed are defaced, and new ones take; and theſe again thruſt out, and the former returning in continual viciſſitudes; ſometimes the Underſtanding encourages the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and other Powers, and they it, as ſeveral Artificers in a Building; at other times there is <hi>a Confuſion of Languages</hi> among them, and they bring forth only <hi>a Babel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But at all times is found here, that great conteſt between the higher Soul, and the Reaſons and Dictates of that, and the contrary ſtruggles of the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, through its correſpondencies and intelligences with the Body, and its Senſualities; the encounters between <hi>the Law of the Mind</hi> and the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, which cauſe great diſtractions and rollings of the Soul, this way and that way, according to the livelineſs of the one, or the violence of the other.</p>
            <pb n="230" facs="tcp:179741:123"/>
            <p>Laſtly, From the Heart ariſe both ſudden, and every way formed and contrived Actions, accompliſhed, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and fledg'd; for all the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and beating out of actions to this or that ſhape, are upon the Anvil of the Heart, and thoſe that break out on the inſtant, had yet their firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from thence; even as all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries and Veins are from the natural Heart, and it hath its Pulſes every where; ſo this Heart we ſpeak of, hath in this Life Moral and Intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual.</p>
            <p>Now that which makes the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of all we have ſpoken in this particular great, is, that according to <hi>theſe Iſſues of life</hi> is the ſtate of a Man in Holineſs or Sin, and ſo he is in an order for Happineſs or Miſery here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</p>
            <p>For by theſe and all theſe, and no other thing whatever, is a Man what he is; with theſe a Man is holy, with theſe he is wicked, nothing elſe gives him his Temper, his Character; and when theſe are twiſted together, and holily moved by the Grace of God, and incited by heavenly motions, the Soul is <hi>then drawn with the Cords of</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Hoſ. 11. 4.</note>
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:179741:123"/> 
               <hi>a Man,</hi> but when they are united in Evil, <hi>it is drawing Iniquity with a</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 5. 19.</note> 
               <hi>Cart-rope, and ſin with the Cords of Vanity,</hi> that is, of a Vain Heart.</p>
            <p>For theſe being neither the higher Reaſon alone, neceſſarily reſulting from the motion and excellency of an Underſtanding, nor being only the meer ſenſuality or inclination of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but truly the ſubſtance, bulk, and ſubſtantial powers and motions of a man; what a man is in theſe he truly is. Further, the true genuine and ſincere motions of theſe are they that try him; for which ever Sin or Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs have the Ballance, and caſt the Scale, that a Man is.</p>
            <p>For on one ſide, the cunning Heart ſends out ſome actions out of choice and inclination, only in complyance with the higher Soul; (for which it cannot but have a reverence) and again, ſometimes, however it be in its own native ſtate corrupt, yet it is forced to receive, or rather ſuffers the ſtrongly agitated impreſſions of enlightened Conſcience upon it: But this is not accounted of with God, who ſees and trys the Heart, and knows the ground and motion of all.</p>
            <pb n="232" facs="tcp:179741:124"/>
            <p>There is alſo that unworthier way of the Heart, when meerly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive its eaſier paſſage to ſenſual En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, it only counterfeits ſome agreeable actions to the higher Soul, and <hi>pays its Vows,</hi> to thoſe ignoble ends, that it may have ſome greater advantages to Voluptuouſneſs, Riches, or Honour; which is the groſſeſt kind of Hypocriſie.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide there are many Infeſtations and troubleſom Inrodes of ſenſuality upon a man, that are truly preponderated by the Diviner Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that yet do not debaſe him in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count with God; ſuch as the Apoſtles <hi>Thorn in the Fleſh,</hi> as it is interpreted <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 7.</note> by ſome, and <hi>the Law of the Members in conteſt againſt the Law of the Mind,</hi> that yet doth not prevail into the Character of a Man, whoſe Heart is upright with God.</p>
            <p>The keeping then of the Heart is of greateſt moment, and it muſt be our care, that <hi>the Treaſure</hi> and Temper of it be good; our obſervation muſt be ever awake upon all, that paſſes out of it, that we may take its true Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter: Our endeavour muſt be ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt to reform all we find out of order,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:179741:124"/> to get it ſwayed by Holineſs, to ſtop the evil Motions of it, till we have ſo diſcouraged them, as to alter the very Temper of it; to incline it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually upon all holy and good Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, till we have endeared them to it; to take heed of all Proffers and Propoſes to it, that we may not ſuffer it to be tempted, to guard it, to offer it to all holy and gracious Converſes, to chaſtiſe it continually in all it does ill, to encourage it in all it does well; and that we may do all this, we muſt <hi>devocare mentem ſupremam è Coelo,</hi> we muſt bring that higheſt Mind, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened by Grace, into the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Command of it, and <hi>detru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere Corpus in imas Terras,</hi> we muſt thruſt down Body, the love of which ſeduces and corrupts the Heart, as low, and as much into ſubjection, as may be: and above all, we muſt commit it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually unto God; for the ſafety, and all the power of even this Supreme Mind is the <hi>Free Princely Spirit of</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſ. 51. 12.</note> 
               <hi>God</hi> eſtabliſhing it, and always join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf with it; as wickedneſs is kept a-foot, by being acted by the Spirit of wickedneſs.</p>
            <p>This Heart now let us conſider, It
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:179741:125"/> is always a beating, the Pulſes of it are every minute and every where; the motion of it is vehement, as Fire; to what a boundleſs meaſure of ſin and iniquity will it riſe, if ſuffered? But to what vaſt degrees of good might it alſo riſe, if its Motions were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved to good? And ſo conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to what degrees of Happineſs or Miſery may it riſe or fall?</p>
            <p>We muſt uſe therefore all our care to be always with it, that we may guide its Motion; that in reſpect to Evil we may reſtrain and ſuppreſs its Motion, as we do that of Fire; that in relation to Good, we may promote and advance it; that in regard of it ſelf we may always provide it enough of true good to feed upon, that it may not inflame nor break it ſelf, by grinding it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Yea we muſt take care of the very Reſt of it, for even that is accounted equal to Action. Reſt in any ſinful Action, till we have removed from it by Repentance, is a continuation of that Action; even as <hi>Gods Reſt</hi> from Creation, yet upholding and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all Things, is expreſſed by <hi>Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> as our Saviour ſpeaks, <hi>My Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
               <pb n="235" facs="tcp:179741:125"/> 
               <hi>worketh hitherto, and I work.</hi> So men uphold ſin by their acquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence in it without Repentance, though they do not proceed to new Acts.</p>
            <p>The nature of the Soul being now thus far expreſſed, It remains as the top and ſum of all, to ſhew that it is made with great and large Receipts for Happineſs or Miſery: Whether we conſider it immediately in the ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Nature, or whether we conſider it in the Faculties and Motions of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the immediate ſubſtantial Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it, as hath been already made plain; It is immortal, made to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue for ever. Whatever melts away from its miſery, the miſery of that is not conſiderable. If a Prince would put an Aſſaſſinate to death with an extreme, but leiſurely torment, and he dyes at the very firſt approach of it, he deceives his puniſhment: So that Happineſs is not deſirable, that ſmothers the Being, that ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy it by the greatneſs of it ſelf; but the Soul made for For Ever, is great in either of theſe, the Happineſs of it infinitely deſirable, the Miſery of it
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:179741:126"/> moſt formidable, becauſe it can abide and ſurvive in either.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is Immaterial, and of ſuch a Fineneſs and Purity of Subſtance, that it pierces far into all Reaſons of Joy or Trouble, and is penetrated by them: The ſympathies of it in Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs or Miſery are ſudden and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal; as the Light ſpreads it ſelf through the Air in a moment, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives in all parts the Light the Sun gives, and inſtantly; thus the Soul, the Favour or Indignation, the Smiles or Frowns of God, when they indeed break out upon it; it is moſt ſenſible, preſently ſenſible, all over and moſt intimately ſenſible.</p>
            <p>But of theſe things I have already ſpoken: Let us further conſider the Faculties themſelves, whereby it is fully fitted to take in Happineſs or Miſery, and to execute them in it ſelf. The Faculties indeed compared with Gods Favour or Diſpleaſure, are but the Inſtruments and Organs; God gives the Breath and the Power, yet they are <hi>fearfully and wonderfully made</hi> by God to theſe great ends, both in their Capacities and Activities.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Underſtanding is that great
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:179741:126"/> Receipt of all Principles of Light and Truths, as may conduce either way; and this is ſuch a capacity, as muſt receive whatever God offers ſo plainly to it, as he will have it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: Thus God manifeſted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the Hearts of the Gentiles; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever prejudiced againſt the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the true God, they could not reſiſt it, but that they muſt needs be <hi>without Excuſe: For that which might be known of God was ſtill ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt in them, for God had ſhewed it to them. So the work of the Law was written in their Hearts,</hi> and they ſhewed it by their thoughts accuſing, or excuſing; and this they could not help: A Table muſt receive what is written upon it; and in the accounts of being Happy or Miſerable upon theſe Principles of Truth, through the Apologies or Accuſations of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and the Motions of the Favour or Diſpleaſure of God upon them, the caſe is the very ſame.</p>
            <p>Now this Underſtanding firſt enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and then lodges Truth; and when that Truth is enlivened and ſtirred up, ſutable impreſſions of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or Grief are made, and from
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:179741:127"/> thence ſtream down with all their force into the Reſt of the Soul; the Underſtanding being indeed ſo much the Soul, that all the rejoicings and complaints of it are preſently heard and reſented through the whole; and the Soul ſo much it ſelf under ſeveral names, that what is in one Faculty of it, is immediately in all, if the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion be indeed to the life; ſaving on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that ſince the degeneracy of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind there remains (as I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſhewn) a ſingle Light in the higher Underſtanding, that may be refuſed in its dictates by the reſt of the Soul.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe then the Underſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the poſſibility of Reſiſtance, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by ſuch a manner of Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, that it cannot but receive of thoſe things that are the true and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Reaſons of Joy or Sorrow, and in their perfection alſo, the Soul muſt needs be in the ſame manner affected it is now, when we plainly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably find our ſelves within the embraces of any great good, or the gripes of Evil; but with this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, that ſo much as the perceptive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Underſtanding ſurmounts
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:179741:127"/> at any time, or the Good and Evil themſelves ſurpaſs, ſo much muſt the Joy or Grief ſurmount and ſurpaſs alſo.</p>
            <p>Although therefore it be true, that the multitude of Men and Women are but half perſwaded of thoſe Things, wherein Heaven &amp; Hell conſiſt, yet this is only becauſe God is not yet pleaſed to excite the Underſtanding after that powerful manner of Conviction he can uſe; but ſtill every man is at the Mercy of Divine Power and Pleaſure, when he will do it: He <hi>may</hi> do it now, but in Eternity he <hi>will</hi> do it, and with ſuch a clear repreſentation, as riſes up into immediate Bliſs or Woe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The next Faculty to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered is the Great Will, that is the Spring of all Affections and their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: How endleſs are the Motions of this Will? <hi>With what a great Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs doth it covet Good? and how long?</hi> What an immenſe averſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and abhorrence of Evil hath it? Let then this Will be denyed Good, or preſſed upon with Evil; or let it be gratified with Good, and ſecured from Evil; what either joy or pain will follow?</p>
            <pb n="240" facs="tcp:179741:128"/>
            <p>Yet further, Let us weigh the Active part of both theſe Faculties, and then the Enjoyment or Suffering will riſe much higher.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt then apprehend but Thought mightily ſet on work, which is the Underſtanding in its natural Motion; and if this be but earneſtly moved, though it be without tormenting mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yet how painful is it? When there is not an Oyl, a pleaſantneſs and ſweetneſs dropping down upon Thought, it is like ſtretching the Joints and Sinews of the Body by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate motion, which, if moderate, would have been refreſhing; or like a great blow that carries the whole force along with it, and falls into the Air only, upon which all the weight of the Body is ready to follow, with a violence moſt ungrateful to Nature: <hi>When a man hath a multitude of Thoughts,</hi> he had need have the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of God to delight his Soul: A Man had need have good bounds for his Thoughts, elſe he loſes himſelf in the Wild of them; he had need of good matter to feed them with, elſe they inflame, like Millſtones, feeding on themſelves; make but this good,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:179741:128"/> a Man may think For Ever, and it will eaſily appear, he may be happy or miſerable For Ever. For let theſe thoughts be ſuch as intereſt a Man in the Reaſons of Torment, Pain, and Horrour, and how grievous may be his ſtate? What experience may eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one have of the trouble and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moil, of the anguiſh of Thoughts? a Man may lye eaſier upon a Rack, than upon ſome diſquieting vexatious Thoughts. On the other ſide, how ſweet and pleaſant are Thoughts full of the Raviſhment of Divine Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations? How delightful is the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment they give without tediouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or ſatiety?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Imagination is ſomething beyond Thought; for Thought runs upon things nearer to what they are in themſelves, but Imagination makes them ſomething beyond themſelves, or aggravates according to their true circumſtances, with greateſt life. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Imagination cannot exceed in Divine or Everlaſting Things, yet it is of uſe to bring in, and repreſent to, and fill the Thoughts; it reflects things with a multiplicity of Images, like the Parelii of the Sun, and ſtays
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:179741:129"/> thoſe Images with great Effect; and ſo it is of great uſe in Comfort or Diſcomfort.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Memory, which doth revive and call things together, and preſent them anew to the Thoughts and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, ſummoning and congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and ſtaying Things their due time for conſideration. This is a great Inſtrument too of Happineſs, or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery: <hi>I will remember the Years of the Right Hand of the moſt High,</hi> was the Relief of, and Recovery of <hi>Davids</hi> Spirit: <hi>Remembring my affliction and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Lam. 3. 19, 20.</note> 
               <hi>my miſery, the wormwood and the Gall, my Soul hath them ſtill in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, and is bowed in me.</hi> Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring this <hi>Vale of Tears,</hi> exalts the lightſome ſtate of <hi>the Holy Hill of God,</hi> and <hi>Remembring the Good things of this Life</hi> an inflammation of miſery.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Conſcience is a high and moſt curious Engine, fitted by God to theſe ends. <hi>What Joy like the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Conſcience,</hi> good and ſerene? The very office of which is to applaud the Soul, and give it greateſt Joy in its acceptance with God, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to him; and on the other ſide, to make acclamations to the Juſtice of
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:179741:129"/> God, and condemn the guilty and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure Soul, within it ſelf, to its greateſt horrour and amazement.</p>
            <p>Come we now to the Active part of the Will, that is, the Affections, which are but the Will boiling up with great love to its Happineſs, or abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of its Miſery; and according as the Affections are ſtirred with deſire of Good and flight from Evil, ſo are they either unexpreſſibly gratified in an union with that Good, and the utmoſt diſtance of the Evil, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged with the deſpair of the Good, that is at an infinite remove from its enjoyment, and deteſtation of the Evil ſo abhorred, yet preſſing and forcing on it ſelf to be endured; from which different Motion of the Affections ſpring plainly and ſenſibly thoſe different conditions of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Miſery.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, When the Underſtanding hath been both the Theatre and Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator of all theſe Motions, it comes to examine over again, whether there becauſe for them; and when upon ſtricteſt enquiry it finds, the cauſe deſerves the whole that hath paſſed; and being by the Divine Power held
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:179741:130"/> cloſe to this Obſervation, it then paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes it ſelf into that grand Act of the Soul, we call Judgment; upon which all the powers of the Soul either ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly triumph, and ſhout in loud praiſes to infinite Mercy; or the Veins of Conſcience open and bleed afreſh, and as by a moſt undoubted authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the Heart renews and continues its everlaſting Plaints.</p>
            <p>The fundamental capacities of the Soul for Happineſs and Miſery being now ſettled, I come now to diſcourſe the correſpondent fundamental ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of that Happineſs or Miſery, as they are united with the Soul, and its actuations of it ſelf: And theſe firſt in relation to its eternal condition.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt and moſt eſſential ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Happineſs is the Favour of God in Chriſt; his Frown, Wrath, and Rebukes are the moſt fundamental reaſon of Miſery: His Favour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled Face on one ſide, his Wrath for ſin on the other. We are not able yet to underſtand the abſolute depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Soul hereupon, becauſe the preſent courſe of Providence al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows men in their ſeeming ſubſiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies upon the Comfort they receive
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:179741:130"/> from the Creatures of this World; God himſelf in the mean time retiring from their Obſervation: But this is certain, the ſmiles of God unexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly enliven, encourage, and bear up the Soul; his Rebukes daunt, deject, and amaze it. However theſe are now for the moſt part cloſely conveyed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the appearances of the Creatures, for us or againſt us, yet God is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed under them; but it is much more plain and manifeſt in the more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate angry or gracious touches of God upon the Conſcience, and will be far more evident in the ſtate of the World to come; <hi>His loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is better than life; and when he with rebukes corrects Man for iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he maketh his beauty to conſume away like a moth;</hi> whatſoever ſeems moſt flouriſhing, being ſo blaſted, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers immediately: All the horrours we have heard, or read of, have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their ſting from this Wrath; and all Conſolations from his Favour; for in his <hi>Favour is life; the Eyes of all Creatures are upon God:</hi> Every created Thing in its proper way turns its Eye upon the Creator, much more the Soul, the Spirit immortal, turns
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:179741:131"/> upon God, <hi>the Father of Spirits, that it may live.</hi> It is not conſiſtent with the Glory of God, that he ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low any Thing to be Happineſs, but Himſelf and his Favour: Even all the inward Rectitude of Mind cannot be this Happineſs immediately; For as if there were a Goodneſs, of which Gods Nature were not the Rule and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and that Will, which always ſtands juſt with that Nature, that would be above God; and ſo God would not be the Supreme Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, that is, Not God: So if there were any implanted Happineſs in any Creature, and that it needed not God, as to the Eſſence of its Happineſs, God would not be God to it; or if its hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs were in any Thing out of it ſelf, and not in God, that would be a God to it.</p>
            <p>This Conſideration preſſes to this, That Happineſs is in <hi>the Light of Gods Countenance,</hi> ſhining out upon the Rational Soul: There is nothing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, as the Fountain of Happineſs, but God; nothing can ſupply his place, <hi>In thy preſence is fulneſs of Joy, at thy right hand are pleaſures for evermore; with thee is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
               <pb n="247" facs="tcp:179741:131"/> 
               <hi>of Life; In thy Light ſhall we ſee Light, but if thou hideſt thy Face we are troubled,</hi> if baniſhed and driven from thy <hi>everlaſting preſence,</hi> we are for ever miſerable; <hi>for whom can we have in Heaven but thee? and there is none upon Earth beſides thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Subordinately to this, there can be no peace, but in the Heart made truly and inwardly Good; beſides all ſtorms from without, there is an eſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, a tide from corruption within, full of trouble and vexation: Every ſin loved and delighted in, is a ſecret hollow where an Earthquake is bred; it is a wound that ſecretly diſquiets it. All impure Affections, <hi>Paſſions of Diſhonour</hi> in the Soul, make it <hi>like the troubled Sea, that cannot reſt; Peace and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt make their repoſe in Righteouſneſs: The effect of Righteouſneſs, is quietneſs and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 32. 17.</note> 
               <hi>for Ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Even as the Favour of God never embraces any, but a holy Soul; ſo hath he ordained, that the Evil and corrupt Heart ſhould be in it ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaceful, and full of turmoil within, both in regard of the foulneſs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, very horrible to the Thoughts,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:179741:132"/> whenever underſtood; as alſo in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the great diſtraction, and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible convulſion the mind is forced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, when it comes to any thing of true Senſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The actuation or gracious mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Favour of God towards the Soul, and the actuation of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit upon the Soul, made inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Holy and Good, are highly neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the making the Spirit of a Man truly ſound and vigorous in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countring Evil, happy and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in it ſelf; for elſe the Soul may be becalmed (if theſe Motions of Grace from God lye ſtill) and not able to bear up it ſelf: And therefore Men ſincerely good are often in great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſures, when God withdraws himſelf from them; In the cloudings of his Face they are troubled, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats of his Grace not exciting them, <hi>they languiſh, and cannot ſtir up themſelves to take hold of him;</hi> and then their ſinful Calm ends in trouble.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide the reaſons of horrour and amazement are not ſeen by ſenſeleſs and ſecure Men, till Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience enlightened diſcovers them,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:179741:132"/> and the flamings of Divine Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure make them boil up.</p>
            <p>Theſe then are the true, ſubſtantial, ſolid, and natural Reaſons of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Miſery, rejoycing or tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Soul, and the Soul is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Senſe of them: And as for the leſſer and ſmaller intereſts of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent World, and the life of it, the obſervation of theſe two following Principles will determine, and ſtate the caſe of the soul in relation to them, and ſo, that it will further appear, that all the touches of Good and Evil up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Man, are originally and principally in his Soul.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt is, That if God is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to let out his Favour in any of theſe outward Things, and to mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the deſires and motions of the Soul, ſo that there is a proportion between thoſe motions and deſires, and the condition in which a Man is, there is nothing further of neceſſity to him, he is well enough. But whenever the deſires run out, beyond the meaſures and proportions of his Condition, it is with great diſquiet and incredible reſtleſneſs of Mind, though the thing, beyond what he has,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:179741:133"/> be but ſmall in it ſelf, and nothing compared with what is enjoyed: When <hi>Haman</hi> had that abundance of <note place="margin">Eſth. 5. 13.</note> Glory, yet his deſires running out to a very little thing, beyond what he had, a very nothing to it, the obei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance of poor <hi>Mordecai,</hi> yet it made a nothing of all he had, <hi>for it all avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him nothing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. When the goodneſs of God is pleaſed to reſtrain outward Evils in fit degrees, and to preſerve the mind from ingaging it ſelf by too cloſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions upon any diſadvantage; or to bend it ſo cloſe, upon better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations to leſſen and make tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable that diſadvantage, the Spirit of a Man thus guarded <hi>will bear any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity;</hi> but when the Spirit is let out to a continual pondering, and aggravating to it ſelf a very ſmall Counter-accident, and the Reaſons that ſhould abate it, are hidden, and carryed off from it, a very little thing becomes unappeaſably vexatious; and <hi>the Spirit ſo wounded</hi> is it ſelf its own inſupportable burden. Who can, when God gives a ſting to ſuch a Croſs, bear it? And when the Spirit of a Man runs forcibly upon it, that
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:179741:133"/> Man may turn back, and recoil with higheſt Rage and Cruelty upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: As we ſee <hi>Ahitophel,</hi> though but <note place="margin">2 Sam. 17. 23.</note> an ordinary thing befell him, yet his Spirit being wounded with it, <hi>he went, and hanged himſelf;</hi> whereas <hi>David</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 30. 6.</note> beſieged with outward Diſtreſs on every hand, and finding the ſurges of Grief within, yet was upheld by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Reaſons: He at the ſame time both diverted his own Spirit from the Evil, qualified the Evil it ſelf, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified his mind, encouraging himſelf in the Lord his God.</p>
            <p>Thus all Contentation and Pleaſure, Enjoyment and Happineſs, and the contrary Diſcontent, Vexation, Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, and Miſery, both here and in Eternity, are laid in the diſpoſes of God upon the Spirits of Men, filling thoſe capacities he hath therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived with ſuch infuſions of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour or Diſpleaſure, as in Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, and Goodneſs, he hath and ſhall determine to them; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo putting themſelves upon ſuch Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and Motion, and that upon ſuch principles within themſelves, as muſt perfectly own, acknowledge, and agree with thoſe his Divine Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:179741:134"/> and the determinations he makes upon the Souls of men accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them.</p>
            <p>Yet there is always this difference between this preſent ſtate, and the things pertaining properly to it; and that of Eternity, and the things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to that; that the former are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether indifferent, and nothing more needs, but that the Mind be in an equal poſture towards them: But the things of an eternal conſideration are of a perfect neceſſity, ſo that Happineſs and Miſery will be for ever in act according to them.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe Grounds thus laid, we may judge of many caſes of ordinary and evident experience, that concern both Natural and Religious Affairs.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We ſee ſome Men in a low and mean condition, with a little of the World, much more contented than thoſe in a higher; the deſires of the one being no larger than their Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but the minds of the other run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning out beyond their greater Eſtate; from whence it is evident, <hi>that man liveth not by bread alone, but by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God, nor by the abundance</hi>
               <pb n="253" facs="tcp:179741:134"/> 
               <hi>of any thing they have,</hi> but by God giving a ſuitableneſs between the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and the Enjoyment; when God lets out the deſire beyond that, all elſe is as nothing at all.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Again, Some men bear far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Croſſes with much more eaſe, than others do far leſſer; the Spirit of one man centring upon the grief and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience, and the other gliding off from it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The generality of men having their minds level, and but equal at beſt with their Bodies, are very ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of all the diſadvantages and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences of Body.</p>
            <p>Some more heroick and ſingular perſons are far above them, and little concerned in them; and ſome ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſenſible and unactive in their Souls, bear them without any more than the juſt preſſure upon the Body requires; lumps of Clay, their Souls are ſo ſheathed in their Bodies, that they diſcover no Soul, give no ſign of a Spirit; they live and dye like Beaſts; they bear all with the ſtrength of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Nature, they ſhew no Spirit at all, till at laſt they ſplit into innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and endleſs Complaints and
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:179741:135"/> Crys; except we ſuppoſe a loathſom ſtupidity, and fearful darkneſs of ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter want of Conſolation and Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be the ſecond death of ſuch perſons</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, Some that have great force of Mind, and yet are deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected to Body, exaſperate and inflame any bodily Diſtemper, and aggravate it by their terrible impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; and the ſame thing falls out to them in Infamy, Diſgrace, Loſs, or great Diſappointment; according to the meaſure, buſineſs, and activity of the Spirit about them, ſo is the thing great or ſmall in mens own account and reſentment.</p>
            <p n="4">4. From an Over-Ballance of Mind it comes to paſs, that upon ſeveral ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts Men become wholly inatten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant to their Bodies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Some ſeparating themſelves, with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Prov. 18. 1.</note> 
               <hi>to intermeddle with all Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> have been wholly careleſs of all things elſe: Others ingaged in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of great Valour and Enterpriſe, have ſo little valued the Fate of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent life, that in the heat of Valour and Fight, they have not ſo much as felt the wounds they have received,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:179741:135"/> their Minds being as it were ſeparated from their Bodies.</p>
            <p>Some plunged in deep ſorrow and trouble, have without the leaſt relent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and compaſſion done the greateſt cruelty upon themſelves.</p>
            <p>Some under great diſappointment of their Deſigns have revenged it with greateſt rigour and reſolution upon their own Fleſh, as <hi>Scaevola</hi> with an undaunted conſtancy burnt the hand that miſſed in killing <hi>Porſenna,</hi> and ſo deprived him of the Glory, he ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſigned himſelf in that Action.</p>
            <p>Others touched with the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of a great Offence, through the vehemency of that, have thought all other pains of Nature worthy only of neglect, as <hi>Cranmer</hi> held that hand in the Flame, that had ſigned his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation.</p>
            <p>Yea very Debauchees, in the Riſque of their Vices, though their name, <hi>even their Fleſh and their Body have been conſumed, mourn</hi> not, while they are in their Carrier, <hi>but at laſt,</hi> they are ſo reſtleſs and importunate in wickedneſs, plotting and performing it, doing it <hi>with both hands,</hi> that they have no leiſure to think of any
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:179741:136"/> thing elſe, and are afraid indeed to offer any ſuch leiſure to themſelves; and to avoid it are always driving on in wickedneſs; <hi>they prolong their days</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Eccl. 8. 12.</note> 
               <hi>in,</hi> and, as it ſeems, by it, thus far, that their earneſtneſs bears them up; ſo that they do not fall into reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon the ſad end of it; their Spirits are carried ſo whole and toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to it, that they have no inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. And if their purſuit be croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and vexed with hindrances, and contrariety of accidents, it becomes very outragious, and is a continual ſickneſs; for ſo it is ſaid, <hi>Amnon was</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 Sam. 13. 2.</note> 
               <hi>ſick for his Siſter Thamar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All theſe, and multitudes of the like, are plain Inſtances of the Mind governing our Contentment, or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, in theſe Affairs; and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it inſlave it ſelf, as it ſeems, to the Body, and its ſatisfactions, yet ſtill it is indeed the Vigour, Force, and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty action of this Mind, that is ever ſuperiour, when it doth moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe it ſelf; and it is not the Body of Fleſh, but it ſelf in that Body, or that Fleſh, (or as the Apoſtle calls it, <hi>a Fleſhly Mind)</hi> that thus deſigns and acts, with a high hand, for its own
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:179741:136"/> ſatisfactions: And if it be thus in things wherein it ſeems to be fleſhly, how much more in thoſe things wherein Body hath no Feeling, no Intereſt?</p>
            <p>From theſe Grounds we may alſo diſcern the ſeveral ſtates of Men in Religion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The great Inſenſibleneſs of it in the minds of moſt men, makes them without any deſire or motion after it, <hi>they ſee no beauty in it, why they ſhould deſire it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Hereupon alſo, though Men have the greateſt reaſon of trouble in relation to their ſtate towards God, yet having no reflections, they are wholly untroubled, even thoſe, who, if Religion be true, have no ground of peace, but the greateſt of horrour and amazement.</p>
            <p>This is indeed from a Patience of God to the world, and a Judgment alſo upon it: for ſo far as it would lead only to the Terrours of Deſpair, ſo it is a long-ſuffering; but as Inſenſible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs conſigns men over to Irreligion, and the conſequent Damnation, ſo it is an exceeding great Judgment.</p>
            <p>And yet it is an Indulgence too of
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:179741:137"/> common Providence, that Mankind enjoys a general peace, and quiet of condition, and are not in immediate helliſh deſpairs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Hence formality in Religion gives many men ſatisfaction: they cannot be ſatisfied without it, their Mind being ſo far awakened concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; and yet there being <hi>ſome part dark,</hi> they take up with a Shadow in the place of true ſubſtantial Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Hence a juſt and ſober demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in the World hath that ſtrength to compoſe the Mind, we may ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily obſerve. For all degrees of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency and Integrity, all Freedoms from Guilt, and not being privy to things unworthy our ſelves, are a great defence to the Thoughts; and theſe things are ſo eſpouſed to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, that where they are found indeed, and in the due Heights, they are never found divided the one from the other: but there may be ſemblances or ſome degrees of theſe; as is very plain in the Inſtance of the Young Man in the Goſpel; he had a truly ingenuous ſenſe of Things, and ſo well natured, that when Chriſt propoſed to him a
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:179741:137"/> Precept above his Orb, he did not ſourly reject it, but was <hi>ſorrowful,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mark. 10. 22.</note> he could not riſe to it, yet ſtill he was at a diſtance from true Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>But ſo far as a man attains in the ſemblances, and degrees of theſe, he hath alſo anſwerable ſemblances and degrees of tranquillity of Mind, of lovelineſs and worth; our Saviour <hi>loved the Young Man,</hi> for ſo much as <note place="margin">v. 21.</note> he had. This made thoſe great Spirits among the Heathen, whoſe generous Actions we read of.</p>
            <p>To this Head may be referred all high and notable Actions and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, all worthy Studies and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, which derive a virtue from that intrinſick value of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and participations of the Favour and approbation of God, that is upon them, and uphold the Mind, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo entertain and employ it, that it doth not fall into diſturbances.</p>
            <p>Yet ſo far as theſe things however excellent, are not univerſal and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form in all things, or not indued and ennobled with true Piety, Love of God, adherence to him in the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, ſo far they come ſhort of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and perfect ſatisfaction of the Mind.</p>
            <pb n="260" facs="tcp:179741:138"/>
            <p>Hence moſt men are but in an equal poize between the Comforts and Fears, that ariſe from a true ſenſe of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, between the Heroick temper of Chriſtianity, and the danger of an unconverted Eſtate; God not ſeeing good to give ſo high a ſenſe of the Danger, nor ſo triumphant a ſenſe of the Happineſs, as that the one ſhould in regard of trouble of Mind, the other in regard of ſurpaſſing joy make, all Things in the World, nothing, as either would do.</p>
            <p>Yet notwithſtanding from the high ſenſe of Religion, there hath been at ſome times ſo high an action, and ſo triumphing a Comfort, that as the Martyr ſaid, A Bed of Flames was no other than a Bed of Roſes, many have offered themſelves to death, <hi>not accepting Deliverance,</hi> they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together abandoned all the Pleaſures, Profits, and Advantages of Bodily Senſe and worldly State, that they might obtain a better Reſurrection; and on the other ſide, ſome under the horrours of Deſpair, have as much caſt away from them, all the comforts and enjoyments of the preſent life, and have ſeized upon Hell, as it were
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:179741:138"/> before they went out of the World, or haſtened to it as <hi>Judas.</hi> Again, ſome good men not having the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of the Favour of God, have fallen into horrid Agonies of Mind, and have been reſtored anew to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, according as God hath ſhone out, or withdrawn himſelf.</p>
            <p>And through the non-actuation of Grace into their Hearts have fallen into ſome great ſins, and under ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual deſertions, abating from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of a Holy Life, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently into diſcomforts, or want of ſpiritual Conſolation.</p>
            <p>And contrariwiſe, Men not ſound in Chriſtian Obedience bear up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt ſome conformities to religious Action, and the hopes they derive from thence, without ſinking down into great deſpondencies. All which caſes plainly and ſenſibly may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved into the former Grounds and Principles laid concerning the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, ordering and diſpoſing the ſtate of Mens Souls here in the World.</p>

               </label> It muſt be in the firſt place allowed, that the Mind ſees much by the Body, and things are accordingly preſented, as the Body is prepared, juſt as the Eye ſees imperfectly through a dim Glaſs, and things appear double in a cracked one; yet this only ſignifies, that the Actions of the Mind, ſo far as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the Body, are either di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed or aſſiſted, by the fitneſs or unfitneſs of the Inſtrument. The Heats of a Fever, by the exceſs of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits flying up, diſturb the brain, and over-act it. Now the Soul acting in, and by theſe Spirits, and in, and by this their exceſſive Motion, ſallies out into a multitude of Thoughts; which are indeed roaving and diſorderly, as is the Motion of the Spirits, which are its Inſtrument; thus the Sun ſeems in haſte, and in a hurry, uneven, and tranſported, appearing through rolling Clouds, and flying Vapours.</p>
            <p>Again, Sometimes the Spirits are aiery and ſoaring, even into Rapture, and then the Soul diſports it ſelf among them, in that we call Wit, and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exalted Phancy; as the Sun reflects its Beams into that beautiful variety, and pleaſant mixture of Colours in
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:179741:139"/> the Rainbow, when it finds a Clowd prepared.</p>
            <p>In theſe caſes the Motion is greater than agrees with the order of the Soul in the Body, and ſo it is violent, and ſometimes furious, yet ſtill it argues the greatneſs of the Soul, and its acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, ſhewing it ſelf to the utmoſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages it receives from the Bodies Motion, whether it be orderly or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly, wherein the activity is the Souls, and the diſorder chargeable up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Body only; the Soul, even as the Sun, is always the ſame in it ſelf.</p>
            <p>But beſides all this, It is moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the Mind hath conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Peace and Diſquiet, ſome in which the Body is not concerned at all, further than the Mind concerns it; and ſome that firſt come into the Mind, by repreſentation from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, yet having made no dint at all upon the Body, are conſidered and judged of firſt by the Mind, and ſo by degrees affect the Body, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the apprehenſions the Mind en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertains of them, either with vigour, or languiſhment; yea there have been Examples, wherein the Soul being it ſelf ſurpriſed, with exceſs of Joy or
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:179741:140"/> Sorrow, hath in a moment ſurpriſed the whole Animal Power alſo, and extinguiſhed that Life; and how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the Soul gives a Conſtitution to the Body, we know not; but this is certain, however the caſe be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, The Comfort or Diſcomfort of a Man is ſeated in his Soul; and whence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the Cauſes of them ariſe, or through whatſoever Conduits they paſs, they pleaſe or afflict according to the ſettled Judgment the Mind makes of them.</p>
            <p>But for the further clearing and confirming theſe things, let us make this account of them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. From the Nature of Mans Soul, it is certainly to be concluded, The Soul is the Man, which way ſoever the Soul goes, that way certainly the Man goes; and when the Soul is in a high concern any way, it values the Body no more, than the Body does a Garment: For though it is true in the generality of men, and in general Caſes, the Soul doth willingly ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate it ſelf to the Body, or rather it ſelf to it ſelf, as in the Body, and makes the ſervice, the ſafety, the pleaſure of it ſelf in the Body, to be
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:179741:140"/> its whole pleaſure, ſafety, and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; yet there are particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons by whom, particular caſes in which, the Body is ſlighted, as of ſmalleſt conſideration. We ſee good men uſe the ſervice of it in Study and Contemplation to ſuch a height, that it is macerated, weakened, diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, and ſpeedily worn out; they <hi>ſubdue</hi> it by daily mortification, they <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 27.</note> offer it up in Martyrdom, deliver and reſign it to the Flames, ſubmit it to the Torturer. Bad Men enſlave it to vicious affections, laviſh it out upon their Luſts; and in their Rage ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times deſtroy it by violence upon themſelves.</p>
            <p>From all which it is plain, how much the Body is at the ſervice of the Soul, when the Soul is excited to the exerciſe of its own power.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The great Myſtery of the Soul is, That whereas in its own Nature it is thus great and commanding, was made in <hi>the Image and Similitude of God,</hi> hath a reſemblance of his Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and even of his infinite Motion, in the diſplays of Underſtanding, Will, and Affections; yet notwithſtanding it may be as it were ſilenced and ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:179741:141"/> and the Motion of it ſo ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, that it ſeems to have nothing ſo conſiderable, as ſuch a Being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports: In this ſtate it is <hi>like a ſtrong Man aſleep,</hi> but that will awake; <hi>it ſleeps its ſleep now,</hi> but when God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakens it, it ſhakes its ſelf, and throws off all its Manacles, <hi>or like a ſtrong man that ſho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>s by reaſon of Wine,</hi> then its ſtrength and vigour appears. It lyes ſtill, <hi>as Samſon, when his Locks were cut off,</hi> it re-enforces it ſelf here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, <hi>as Samſon, when his Locks were grown again;</hi> like Water running ſoftly, and in a very weak, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcernible Current, afterwards like an Inundation of Water; like a Spark under Aſhes, but afterwards like the whole Element of Fire, in fierceſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſo that there is no judgment to be made of its influences into the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort or Diſcomfort of a Man, when it is in its duller and more ſtupified condition, but in its higheſt Flights now, and in its Everlaſting State.</p>
            <p n="3">3. God hath the great power of moving the Soul, <hi>he that formed the Spirit of a Man within him,</hi> he that made it what it is, that gave it his own likeneſs, he will ſhew when he
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:179741:141"/> pleaſes that he made it ſuch as it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; and it muſt needs be plainly in his power to do it, who is the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme and All-working Spirit; ſo that all the ſtate and condition of it from the firſt moments of its Being, throughout Eternal Ages, is a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Ordination of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it: Nothing then is to be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but by and upon his declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of himſelf, and of the manner of his Government he hath preſcribed to himſelf; which is in part made known to us in the Nature, Frame, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Soul it ſelf, and the daily Experiments of it, but moſt eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in his Word; which deſcribes both the deplumed and low eſtate of Souls, and the certain exaltation, the lifting them up whether to Salvation or Deſtruction.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The things the force and ſtrength of the Soul move upon, as deſcriptive and conſtitutive of its own ſtate and condition, give temper to its Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Diſquiets. When it moves upon ſuch things, as have truly the Springs of Joy and Comfort in them, as its own, it hath an exceeding Joy, that carries it above all things. Again,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:179741:142"/> when it moves upon thoſe things, that have indeed the reaſons of Sorrow and Affliction, and that it muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it hath an unhappy Right to; there is an exceſs of Sorrow and Vexation. If there are but apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded reaſons of either, or lower de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of them aggravated by that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, the force of the Soul may yet make them great, till it be unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; for when there is nothing worthy either way to work upon, yet its very deceived and deluded Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination are in the room of a great Object to it, and either very pleaſing, or afflictive. Thus it is till Reality takes place of Appearance; and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity finds ſo much employment for all the Powers, upon things ſo grand, that they have nothing of leiſure, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Appearances, or leſſer Things, or to ſpend their ſtrength in vain.</p>
            <p>Thus far I have argued the Motions of the Soul unto Happineſs or Miſery, immediately from the Nature of the Soul it ſelf; in the next place, let the account of theſe things be drawn from the Ordination and Government of God in relation to himſelf, and the eternal condition of the Soul.</p>
            <pb n="269" facs="tcp:179741:142"/>
            <p n="1"> 1. There is an Abſolute Will, and Determination of God, that it ſhall appear, that Himſelf and Holineſs, and the enjoyment of Himſelf for ever, are the true Happineſs of the Soul, and the only Happineſs of it; on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, That Sin, his Wrath, and Disfavour are the greateſt Evils; as God ſays, <hi>I will famiſh all the Gods of the Earth,</hi> ſo he will all that the Earth calls Good, beſides himſelf, which is a worſhipping of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, beſides, or in preference to, the Creator, bleſſed For Ever: Elſe Men, who are in Covenant with ſeeming Goods, and in Union with them, would think themſelves well enough without God, and without any enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him; God therefore hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a time, wherein all the Idols of the World ſhall be ſmitten, <hi>as Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon before the Ark,</hi> and all little Evils, that are ſo reputed here, ſhall ſhrink into none, compared with his Wrath and Diſpleaſure. Then ſhall Men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon all the Fatigues they have undergone for worldly Pleaſure, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, and Honour, as ſo much loſt and miſplaced labour; and their ſo earneſt recoil from preſent Evils, though with
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:179741:143"/> their eternal hazard, ſhall be reputed as baſeſt Cowardiſe; then Religion and Holy Walking, which had ſo mean an allowance of Deference from them, ſhall be eſteemed of greateſt worth and value.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God hath determined to draw out Souls to their own Greatneſs and Extent, that his Workmanſhip in them may not be always hid and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed. The ſimilitude with himſelf he at firſt enſtamped them with, ſhall be plainly diſcovered. It ſhall then be ſeen, what Underſtandings, Wills, Affections, Conſciences he hath given them; and that a Soul is not ſo ſmall a Thing, as it ſeems to be in the Worlds Hiſtory of Beings.</p>
            <p>And theſe two things are very ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to the diſcovery of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Excellency of God, and the Valuableneſs of the Soul; for God revealing himſelf, and his own Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Happineſs, in their full Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Greatneſs, the Soul that was ſhrivell'd up in ignorance of true Good, opens and ſtretches out it ſelf, as the Eye to the Sun, or as the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite to the moſt guſtful, or delicious meat; and when the Soul is drawn
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:179741:143"/> out to its own Largeneſs, then will it know the vanity of all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides God, and that its great Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Deſires cannot be ſatisfied by any thing Lower, or Leſſer, than he is; but ſhall feel the extremities of want, the neceſſities of inraged and unſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied deſire in the loſs of him; and the great Motions of Mind will make fierceſt reflections on the Evil of Sin, and the Righteous Diſpleaſure of God: But on the other ſide, Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in the Favour and Enjoyment of God, ſhall flow in upon the extended Deſires and Affections, and the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the Mind ſhall adore and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the greatneſs of Divine Glory, and the bleſſedneſs of enjoying it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. God hath reſolved upon De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Happineſs and Puniſhment: Now the more the Soul is enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and its Faculties heightened, the more capable it is of Glory; <hi>Thus one Star differs from another in Glory;</hi> having a greater Orb for the recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Light, having a purer and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Light: So alſo the more the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties are enlarged, the more capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble they are of Woe and Puniſhment, and <hi>to be beaten with more ſtripes.</hi> The
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:179741:144"/> more therefore any one finds his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties now quickened and opened, the more he may apprehend, and ſo be the more excited to fear the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and lay hold on the Happineſs.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Seeing all depends upon the Actua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion either of the Mercy and Goodneſs of God, or his Indignation; from hence appears both the Freeneſs of his Grace and Mercy in Chriſt, in the glorification of his Saints, and the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of his Indignation and Wrath in the Puniſhment of wicked men: For though all things that God does in theſe things, are contrived into the greateſt Conveniences and Aptneſs to their ſeveral Ends, yet if he did not continually move them, <hi>in whom all things live, move, and have their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> that do live and move or have any being, all would lye ſtill, and there is no other Power that could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite them; for who can move before him, or beſides him, ſeeing he moves all himſelf? and he who is moved on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by himſelf, and from himſelf, can receive no Motion from any other: The Apoſtle therefore thus expreſſes both ſides of theſe things; <hi>What if God willing to ſhew his Wrath, and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 22.</note>
               <pb n="273" facs="tcp:179741:144"/> 
               <hi>make his power known, and that he might make known the Riches of his Mercy: So then he hath mercy on</hi> 
               <note place="margin">V. 18.</note> 
               <hi>whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe things being thus fixed, let us further enlarge upon them, by way of Conſectary: And firſt, we are led by them to theſe three Petitions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let us pray, that God would keep and contain our Deſires and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions within due bounds, that we may not exceed our Condition, by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly Appetite; nor pore too much upon the Diſadvantages and Vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our Condition: For if our Souls are let out above due meaſure, how full of Torment and Agony may we be? <hi>He faſhions the hearts of Men alike,</hi> or to an equality, to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; for he <hi>as the Potter</hi> moulds the Clay, and fits it to this or that Figure; <hi>The Father of Spirits forms the Spirit of Man within him;</hi> and he doth it in Mercy, or Judgment, as he pleaſes, yet with righteouſneſs, <hi>and plenty of Juſtice:</hi> Moſt neceſſary it is therefore, that into his <hi>Hand we at all times commend our Spirits,</hi> not only when we are going out of the
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:179741:145"/> Body into thoſe unknown Regions, but while we are here in the Body, that we may be kept within due Meaſures.</p>
            <p>Further, It is moſt neceſſary to pray, <hi>That God would feed us with Food</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Prov. 30. 8. 1 Chron. 4. 10.</note> 
               <hi>convenient for us, that he would bleſs us indeed, and enlarge our Border</hi> to juſt proportions, and that he would keep away Evil from us, in ſuch a degree, that it may not grieve us, piercing us too deep, <hi>that we may not fall into Temptations,</hi> murmurings and diſcontents againſt God; into Rages and Fury againſt our ſelves: This is <hi>to bleſs us indeed,</hi> when our Minds and our Condition are equally poiz'd; when Divine Providence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions our Condition to our Minds, and our Minds to our Condition.</p>
            <p>When God does not thus preſerve Mens Souls, how do they fall, <hi>as Saul under an Evil Spirit,</hi> forſaken of God? They fall firſt upon the edge, and point, of their own edged, point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Thoughts, and then upon their Sword. And thus it would be with all Men, did not God ſweeten their Spirits with <hi>his Bleſſings of Goodneſs, as with the joys of Harveſt,</hi> and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:179741:145"/> them with his benign Influences, as with the gladneſs of Corn, Oyl, and Wine.</p>
            <p>God gives us many Documents of the force and vehemency of our Souls, in the examples of ſome tranſported with Divine Joy, even to Raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; another falling into greateſt Agonies of Mind and Thought; in the dark and ſad part of whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, we are not to think, that they had greater ſins, or ſharper thoughts, than others; but they <hi>are our Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> and teach us, what we ſhould be, if God did not qualifie us now; and what we ſhall be in Eternity, if not reconciled to God, and thereby alſo to our ſelves; we ſhall fall with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Fury and Rage upon our ſelves: For it is but a little thing, what a Man executes with his own Hand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Body now, in compariſon of thoſe Rages, wherewith he will fall upon himſelf in Eternity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We have need to pray, That God would draw out our Souls now, that we might ſee them, and know them; for we do not enough under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand our Souls, we conſider them not, becauſe we lye ſtill. But why
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:179741:146"/> ſhould it be hard to conceive? That as Mens Souls are now awakened by Study, Obſervation, Action, ſo much more by entring into another World, the moſt ſtupid Soul may be awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, being let looſe out of the Body: It ſhould be therefore our moſt earneſt Prayer, that God would open us to our ſelves, that we may not make proviſion for our ſelves only, as ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, as we ſeem to be, and leſt when we come to dye, we fall into thoſe horrible amazes, that will ariſe from being miſtaken in our ſelves; but that ſeeing, and knowing what we are, we may make ſo great a proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for our ſelves, as our caſe requires, and ſo not be for ever miſerable, through our not ſo much as half mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of our ſelves, and proviſions ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We have need to pray, That God would draw out our whole Minds upon himſelf, and Chriſt our Lord, in a way of Deſire and Affection, of Joy and ſatisfaction; and that we may be repleniſhed with ſuch aſſurances of the love of the Father in his Son, that we may have no occaſion to be cruel to our ſelves: For as extremity of want
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:179741:146"/> and hunger turns men, as Tygers, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their own Fleſh, ſo the Horrours ariſing from the Wrath of God, and the unappeaſable want of him, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the Soul againſt it ſelf; but the enjoyment of him infinitely bleſſes and ſatiates it with pleaſure, ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens it into greateſt love and kindneſs to its own ſelf. And the Spirit thus ſupported will <hi>bear any other infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> as <hi>David,</hi> having God <hi>for his Light and Salvation, feared nothing; Habakkuk</hi> deprived of all favourable appearances, neither the <hi>Fig-tree bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoming, nor any Fruit on the Vines, the labour of the Olive failing, the Flock cut off from the Fold, and no Herd in the Stalls, yet he rejoyced in the Lord, and gloried in the God of his Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the ſecond place, We may upon this Head of Diſcourſe, make theſe doctrinal Recollections.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is a high pitch of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, or a very low degree of Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to which every Man is prepared: For the further deſcription of which, let us conſider the two great Orders of Spirits, Happy, and Miſerable, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; to one of which we ſhall ever have a likeneſs.</p>
            <pb n="278" facs="tcp:179741:147"/>
            <p>The Head, the Supreme, the Prince of the firſt Order, is <hi>Jehovah</hi> himſelf, who in the higheſt and moſt perfect Act of his own Infinite Underſtanding and Will, and the higheſt Satisfaction in Himſelf, and enjoyment of Himſelf, lives from Eternity to Eternity, <hi>the moſt Happy and only Potentate, with his Eternal Son, and Spirit;</hi> without any Diſſatisfaction, Diſcompoſure, Wearineſs, or Tediouſneſs to Himſelf, or the leaſt Shadow of impreſſion upon him from Without.</p>
            <p>This is infinitely clear concerning God; <hi>In his Preſence is fulneſs of Joy, at his Right Hand are Pleaſures For Evermore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we could imagine, as indeed we cannot, becauſe Experience ſo mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contradicts it, that any Prince ſhould live in all thoſe Delights and Pleaſures the moſt ſplendid Court affords, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any tediouſneſs or ſatiety ten thouſand years; what a dark repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation were this of God? though he could do and enjoy all he would.</p>
            <p>Let us then imagine higher, That a Prince of wiſeſt, moſt refined, and delightful Speculation, could live in the Height and perfect Reſt of a moſt
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:179741:147"/> pleaſurable Contemplation, without the leaſt diſquiet; how lowly an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem would this be of the infinite Bleſſedneſs of God? Now God made Man in his own Image and likeneſs, ſo that the Soul of Man is capable of a communication of this Bleſſedneſs, in the perfection of his Underſtanding and Will, enjoying God with unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible Joy, and Peace, and yet in the higheſt Life of Action.</p>
            <p>Under God are the Bleſſed Angels, of whom the Scripture ſpeaks, both of their Knowledge, Perfection, and Power, joined with Holineſs and Obedience to God, who have been Participants of the Glory and Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, from the firſt Dawn of Creation, and in all this time have not had leaſt tiredneſs or ſatiation, but higheſt Bliſs and Joy. Next to theſe are the <hi>Spirits of Just Men made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;</hi> who are by ſucceſſion, as they go out of the World, taken into this Happineſs.</p>
            <p>Now in all theſe Inſtances it plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appears, to what a height of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs Holy Men are deſigned, being made like God, <hi>equal to Angels,</hi> in the aſſurance of which good Mens
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:179741:148"/> Souls enjoy the Conſolations of that better ſtate in this, and are daily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved into it, when they dye.</p>
            <p>For the Order of Spirits Miſerable and Unhappy, Spirits, of which <hi>the Devil is the Prince,</hi> although indeed there cannot be ſuch a Miſery, as ſhould ſtand a counterpoiſe to Gods Happineſs; for Miſery is but a retreat from God and his Happineſs, from his Favour and Grace, as Darkneſs is from Light, and being under the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions of his Wrath; yet all this is within the incloſure of a Finite Being, and were there not an unchangeable Will of God, and a Decree of his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, that he will not reverſe, all Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery might be removed off from the moſt Unhappy of Beings, and taken quite away.</p>
            <p>But as things are, The Miſery of Spirits may be thus underſtood in the great Exemplar of it, the Miſery of Fallen Angels, and the Prince of them, the Devil.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is a Height and utmoſt ſtretch of Action. The Devil is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented as always in Motion, from the firſt beginning of Miſery he hath no Reſt, even while he is in Chains,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:179741:148"/> as fierce Maſtives, he moves as far as he can, and rages at the ſhortneſs of his Chain; he hath had no ſleepy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Non-action, ſince the day of his fall, no Breathing Time, no Truce: Thus the Soul in Miſery is extended, as we now ſpeak, day and night, that is perpetually, without intermiſſion, with an endleſs Action and Motion. Conſider, what is Reſt and Sleep to a Man of a tormented Mind, and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Thoughts; a Sleep wherein he is <hi>not ſcared with Dreams, and terrified with Viſions,</hi> how unhappy doth he think himſelf in the want of it? how unwilling is he to be awakened out of it? And from thence underſtand the Miſery, of being perpetually awake in Miſery.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is an ignobleneſs, a baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in all his Motions, <hi>he goes upon his Belly, and eats Duſt;</hi> he hath no Motion that can give him comfort from any glimmering of worthineſs, or generoſity in it; in all the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of his Motions, he has none that can in the leaſt cool the Furnace of his tormented Thoughts: Any Degree of Worthineſs in his Action would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate his Unhappineſs. All is full of

            <p n="3">3. There is a Horrour, Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and trembling Senſe of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Juſtice, Holineſs, and Power of God over him, with the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his own Guilt; <hi>The Devils be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi>

               <hi>and tremble.</hi> The Fountain of Life, Beauty, and Happineſs is Hell from Heaven to them; becauſe they find nothing in themſelves, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and contrariety, horrid enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and hatred: They are convinc'd of
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:179741:149"/> that High Juſtice and Righteouſneſs in the midſt of ſo great Wrath and Vengeance upon them; and this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leiſure or intermiſſion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore perpetually ſhake with Fear and Horrour, while they are moſt Daring againſt God. Thus alſo the Souls of Damned Men lye for ever trembling under the Juſtice of God. Now we know by experience, that ſome Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes exerciſing Men with a continual Trepidation, are therefore moſt dreadful and diſmal; and ſome Mens Conſciences being all in an Agony, put them into a moſt lamentable Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling. What then is the condition of thoſe, who fall into the extremity of theſe things, and that For Ever? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which yet inſenſible Men haſten in great numbers.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Hence we may learn the more general ſtate of Good and Bad Men here in the World, and the Reaſons of both: The ſtate of Good Men not full of the Conſolations of God; of wicked Men not full of the Horrours, and Torments of Hell.</p>
            <p>In Good Men, there is a poize be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the diſcomforts of bodily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience, and of the preſent life,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:179741:150"/> the fears and ſad apprehenſions that pertain to their ſtate towards God, and the great danger of Hell, on one part; and the Favours of God to them, in the gracious ſupports of this life natural, inlaid with the more bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Tokens of his love to them in Chriſt, the immediate Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts he gives them, the hopes they have eſcaped that greateſt of dangers, on the other part.</p>
            <p>In Bad Men, there is a poize between the pleaſures and enjoyments of Life preſent, the great inapprehenſiveneſs of Eternal Things, yea fooliſh Hopes and Dreams of the Bleſſedneſs and Happineſs of it, giving greater ſcope to ſenſuality to play its part; theſe in one Scale: The many Troubles, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiets, and Diſappointments they meet with in this World, the ſudden Blows of Conſcience, and qualmy forethoughts of another World, lying in the other Scale.</p>
            <p>Now all this is a low ſtate of Souls, and a diſpenſation of God for holy and wiſe Reaſons, intending ſuch a kind of ſtate <hi>for the time being;</hi> like that of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Worſhip, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, which were only outward, and
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:179741:150"/> terrene, <hi>till the time of Reformation;</hi> ſo is the ſtate of the Souls of Men here in the World, both of good and bad Men.</p>
            <p>This ſtate of Good Men in the World, is both in Mercy and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the World.</p>
            <p>In Mercy, For there being ſuch a mixture of the Intereſts and Concerns of Good Men, with the general Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs and Intereſts of the World, there is for their ſakes a great care and heed of Providence over the courſe of this World; and as it is uſually ſaid, If there were never a Righteous Man in the World, the whole World would be deſtroyed; ſo if their Intereſts were taken out of it, there would be a preſent Ruine upon the Affairs of it; their Perſons and Intereſts are of great advantage to the World, that it might not be managed by Evil Men only.</p>
            <p>Now if their Affections were ſo highly moved after God, Eternal life, and the Things of that Life, and the Conſolations received from them were anſwerable, all the Things of this Life would be of ſuch an undervalue, that they would not mind the care of
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:179741:151"/> Things below, nor have any Intereſts here, as the Primitive Chriſtians, that were negligent of all Things, but the <hi>Better Reſurrection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, It is in ſeverity to the World, for if there were ſuch an illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious preſence of Religion, and the Life of it, it would certainly draw many more in to it, as many in thoſe firſt Times, that had never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered Chriſtianity before, ran into the embraces of it, though upon the Sword, into Flames, and preſent Death; but now Religion appearing ſo deſpicable, not only in regard of its addreſs, carried off from Senſe, but much more in the want of the Power, Life, and Luſtre of it ſelf, it comes to paſs ſo very few are invited into it.</p>
            <p>It is alſo in chaſtiſement upon Good Men, and the remaining corruption of degenerate Nature, that they are not more exalted in the Heights and Glories of Chriſtianity, and its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place, That Men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted to God are not for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality more affrighted, and affected with the Fears of eternal Wrath and
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:179741:151"/> Puniſhment, and only moved with the preſent Evils, according to the degree of impreſſion they make upon them, is in long-ſuffering, it being much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for Men themſelves, and all they have to do with, that they are not in thoſe horrible conditions of <hi>Saul, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> and <hi>Cain,</hi> who were not promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Repentance by thoſe Terrours, and became a Terrour to all round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them: For if Men have not that only uſe of them, that can counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail their pain, it is a Mercy to be out of this Hell, while they are here up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth. Taking then the ſtate of the World, as it is, it is a great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of the Patience of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Men, and without which the condition of the World could not ſtand: For Men in thoſe Terrours mind not the World, while they are in it, and violently haſten out of it; ſo that if the generality of Men unrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to God were in ſuch a caſe, there would be no management of Humane Affairs, no enjoyment of them, but an univerſal diſtraction, and diſconſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateneſs.</p>
            <p>And yet there is a Juſtice in it alſo, That Men in a Dream of Peace, and
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:179741:152"/> deep Ignorance of their Souls, and an Eternal Condition, ſhould move to the Miſery of it, and not conſider whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they move; their Souls and the Eternal Condition being ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed from them. And that great Atheiſm, Wickedneſs, and general ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality of the World, takes advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage and incouragement from hence, and Godlineſs hereupon becomes not a matter of neceſſity, but of the Grace of God, and the holy choice of Good Men.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Yet in the third place, God may raiſe the Soul to a great Degree of the Conſolations of Eternal Happineſs, and impoſe a great Degree of the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of Hell upon it, if he pleaſes.</p>
            <p>Of the firſt, <hi>Davids</hi> expreſſions are a Teſtimony; <hi>They ſhall be abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>

            <p>Of the latter, What dreadful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are <hi>Cain</hi> crying out, <hi>My ſin is</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gen. 27. 38.</note> 
               <hi>greater than can be forgiven; Eſau</hi> yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out ſo dreadfully for the Bleſſing; <hi>Saul under an evil Spirit,</hi> going to the <note place="margin">1 Sam. 28. 7.</note> Witch, becauſe God had forſaken him, and at laſt falling upon the point of his Sword; <hi>Ahitophel hanging him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 31. 5.</note> and <hi>Judas ſtrangled with his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy Horrours?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If a Mans Underſtanding, Affections, Thoughts, Deſires, with all their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, were extended, and run high upon God, and Holineſs, and the eternal enjoyment of him, and the comforts of God delighting all theſe, and the Oyl of Grace gliding along upon them, even down upon the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, <hi>like the precious Oyntment on the Head of Aaron, going down to the skirts of his Garments;</hi> how ſweet would theſe interweavings of the Soul and its trueſt and everlaſting Joys be, even <hi>unſpeakable and full of Glory?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the other ſide, when a Man is
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:179741:153"/> firſt racked, and ſtretched into vaſt and inſatiable Deſires, without ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and rolled up and down upon a thouſand uneaſie Thoughts concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, and, inſtead of mitigation, and cooling allays, hath the guilt of his unworthy Actions, and the fears of a Juſtice to diſquiet him; how uneaſie muſt ſuch a Mans Soul of neceſſity be to him? and if theſe are wreathed cloſe about him, and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed home upon him by the Indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God, let out againſt him; as the former is a little Image of Heaven, ſo is this of Hell.</p>
            <p>Now it is certain, <hi>No man hath power over his own Spirit,</hi> either to damp the gracious and merciful mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings of his Divine Spirit, or to keep out and forbid the angry entrances of Divine Diſpleaſures, and Revenges: <hi>God is the God of the Spirits of all Fleſh,</hi> and acts them as he pleaſes. No man can imprint upon himſelf the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Comfort or Diſquiet, or flaſh into his own Soul, Joy or Sorrow, but under the guidance and ſupreme go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of God, who <hi>giveth quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſo as none can make trouble, and ſo hides his face that none can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold</hi>
               <pb n="291" facs="tcp:179741:153"/> 
               <hi>him: As he pleaſes he caſts down, and raiſes up, and none can ſtay his hand, ſo much as within themſelves, or ſay unto him, What doſt thou?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So great is his Freedom herein, that he ſometimes anſwers Men, that are ſtrangers to him, in the joy of their hearts, all their lives; and his word of Bleſſing goes along with the ordinary favours he does them, ſo that the Fears of Wrath to come are hid from them; and on the other ſide, thoſe whom he hath made his Friends, and will uſe ſo for ever, are covered with a Cloud, nay ſometimes he ſets them <hi>as a mark for his arrows,</hi> and even <hi>cuts them off with his Terrours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For he is the great Actuator of Mens Spirits, without whom, as the firſt Mover, the whole Motion of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would ſtand ſtill; and he diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes them ſo, that a Man doth, nor can to any ſatisfactory account find out himſelf; and he therefore feels his greateſt ſecurity in reſting upon God, and being guided by him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But Eternity is that vaſt ſeaſon, in which God brings all to a righteous certainty, and which he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for Happineſs without allay,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:179741:154"/> or Miſery <hi>without mixture,</hi> which may be made out three ways.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In that in Eternity the whole power of the Soul runs together one and the ſame way: In this life the holieſt Men have great allays of their holieſt and beſt Motions, and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions of Diſcontent, and Unbelief to their greateſt Comforts; Evil men have generally at leaſt ſome pleaſures, hopes, motions to their advantage, notwithſtanding all the croſſes they meet with in the World, or the ſecret ſounds of horrour they have at certain times in their Conſciences.</p>
            <p>In this World the Soul ſends out parties of it ſelf, divers ways, or to ſeveral ends. The Judgment may be pleaſed in the main, and yet the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons diſturbed; or theſe more ſtill, and yet the Judgment diſſatisfied and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed: One Thought goes out in high diſcontent, another flyes after it, recalls, and reconciles it: On the other ſide, one Thought leaps out of the Soul with pleaſure, another reproves, daunts, and dejects it with a correction of its haſte. But in Eternity the Soul is united in its Motions, which way one Faculty goes, all go; and the
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:179741:154"/> Thoughts are all concentred as in one whole and entire Thought of Joy or Torment.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In Eternity there is but one ſtate of the Soul, and the proſpect of the Soul is but one. In this World change of place, converſation, diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Events raiſe different Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Motions of Mind; varieties of buſineſſes, occaſions, and tempers upon them, do ſo diſtract and move all ſorts of Men up and down, that there is nothing pure and unconfoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: In Eternity there is one ſtate of Soul, and ſo one action; there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to mix with either condition: It is one Happineſs, or one Miſery.</p>
            <p>Even the moſt ſad and diſmal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, the proſpect upon Hell and Eternal Miſery, gives to the Saints rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of admiration, and higheſt ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of God, in their deliverance from it: On the other ſide, the moſt glorious Bleſſedneſs and Happineſs of Heaven, is to Men in Hell, when they look up to it, their higheſt Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and inflames their Torment, by reaſon of their envy againſt God, and thoſe that dwell with him in Heaven, their reflections upon their own Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:179741:155"/> and Rage againſt themſelves. Thus one State, one Action, one Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, one Miſery, and all to the height, fill Eternity.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Then it is that God proceeds to the higheſt actuation of the Soul, drawing out all the powers of it, and ſetting open all <hi>the Windows of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> upon it, pouring into it all the always full, and ever flowing Vials of his Love, Grace, and Mercy; or of his Power, Wrath, and Juſtice; which as they are unintermitted themſelves in their ſtreams, ſo it is impoſſible, the Soul that is moved, or driven by them ſhould reſt from an action anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In Eternity there is a Body fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Happineſs or Miſery of the Mind. In this World Happineſs is dulled by the ſtupidities, or clogged with the ſlowneſs of the Bodies Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or grows cloying by its incapaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to receive more. The pains and griefs of it call the Mind from its en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, to take pity on it, ſo that the inconveniences of the Body allay the happineſs of the Mind; on the other ſide, this Body ſubmits it ſelf to ſpeedy diſſolution, if its own pains
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:179741:155"/> are extreme; and its griefs if leiſurely and tolerable are abated by being ſo, as, if over burdenſome, they deſtroy: The troubles of the Mind are much blunted by the groſſneſs of Body, in which the Mind cannot feel perfectly its own ſentiments; and the pleaſures and divertiſements of that Body do often allay the anguiſh of Conſcience; as <hi>Cain</hi> grew to ſome quiet with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>by building a City:</hi> But in Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity <note place="margin">Gen. 4. 17.</note> the Body is alſo ſpiritual, that is, wholly prepared to the uſe and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Spirit, and to receive, and attend, and diſplay its Motions, and condition, to feel its pleaſures and pains, to bear its Glory or Deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty openly; all kinds of theſe preſent bodily Pleaſures and Pains, Beauties or Deformities being then wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved. For either the Happineſs or Miſery of meer Body is neither wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of God, nor of the Soul, but would be on the one ſide a ſottiſh Pleaſure, on the other ſide like the tormenting of a Beaſt, and ſo not agreeable to God, or the diſcourſe of Scripture, however things may be repreſented to our ſenſe, and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the diſplay of theſe things may
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:179741:156"/> paſs into the Body, and be all ſeen there; yet we know, the moſt exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive pleaſures of Body interrupt the proper motions of Soul, in which true Happineſs or Miſery lye, for neither is a man drenched in an irrational plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, nor tormented, and he knows not why; but there is an orderly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a ſenſe of ſin and guilt, of the ſupreme Juſtice of God in his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Executions of Judgment; in Happineſs an adoring of Infinite Grace and Mercy, a Rational Taſte of Holy and Divine Pleaſures.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now, as a Concluſion, draw up all this Diſcourſe into theſe practical Concluſions flowing from the whole.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Hereby I underſtand I have an immortal and everlaſting Soul, to take care of; we look upon our ſelves <hi>as Fleſh and Blood,</hi> but we do not conſider theſe Immortal Spirits, and their great Powers, Underſtanding, Imagination, Will, Conſcience, Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and the motion of theſe to be Everlaſting: We do not examine, whether our Souls have a true Health, Peace, and Safety, and a good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion made for them? Whether our Conſciences are quiet, and upon
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:179741:156"/> good grounds? Whether our Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are purified and holy? For a man to conſider his Soul thus, is indeed to conſider a mans ſelf; <hi>What ſhall it</hi>

               <hi>profit a man, if he gain the whole World, and loſe himſelf?</hi> The Soul is a true Self, and how dreadful will the miſtake appear to men? who have counted the Body, and the Intereſts of that, the only Self; and this other true, the greateſt Self ſtarts out: A Self, that now lyes under as many Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, as a Body under a multitude of Garments, and ſo is concealed: But then it breaking out, and not being provided for, that great principle of ſelf preſervation, finding now its greateſt Object, will force a man to cry out with a moſt dreadful Ejula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Complaint, Oh this falſe Self that I have laboured for, how hath it deceived me? My very Self I never thought of, and ſo have loſt it: What ſhall I give now in exchange for this my true Self?</p>
            <p n="2">2. I hereby underſtand, I am made for Holineſs, as the true Peace and Greatneſs of my Spirit, for a converſe with God, for an attendance upon him, for an obſervation of his Favour
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:179741:157"/> and Countenance towards me, and that herein is <hi>the Life of my Spirit;</hi> and on the other ſide, I am very apt to be tempted to ſin, and drawn away from God, to live at a diſtance from him, to loſe him, and herein at laſt will be found the Torment and Hell of Souls; and therefore I have great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt reaſon to be awakened about theſe things, and earneſtly to pray to God, that he would put me into a high and vigorous action concerning them, and to be extremely unſatisfied, when I find my ſelf inſenſible concerning them, and therefore to labour earneſtly to be in a good ſtate and condition in relation to them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I hereby underſtand, I am made and deſigned, and ſhall certainly be unexpreſſibly Happy or Miſerable to extremity; and who can ſay this to himſelf, without higheſt concern up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his own Soul? If any one ſhould tell us, we were ordained to be one of theſe, extraordinarily happy and proſperous, or deplorably unhappy, and were about to read our Fate or Doom to us, and that we had conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Reaſons to believe ſuch a one, who would not with a moſt trembling
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:179741:157"/> ſuſpenſe of mind wait what it ſhould be? When any one is to receive the Iſſue of his Cauſe from a Judge or Jury, how high and impatient is his expectation? But how much more ſhould our Thoughts wait for this Iſſue of Things? and God hath placed it in the motions of theſe our own Thoughts; for when they move, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened with his Countenance, cleanſed and annointed with his Grace, ennobled with his Spirit, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with his Conſolations, this is Heaven begun, this is Happineſs grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up: When they are baſe for want of his Spirit, impure with Luſt and diſhonourable Affections, full of ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour and bitterneſs, and all ſpotted and ſtained with guilt; this is Hell in the Foundations of it laid.</p>
            <p>And however my Soul lye ſtill now, yet when I ſee how many things draw out mens Souls, even in this Life, Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, better Converſe, Solitude, ſome great danger or loſs in the world, higher Condition, Sickneſs, ſome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Diſcourſe, as in <hi>Foelix;</hi> how much more muſt I needs think the change into Eternity will do it? and therefore no ſilence of my Soul now
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:179741:158"/> can encourage me upon ſerious conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration to be careleſs of it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I hereby underſtand my unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able dependence upon the Grace of God, and his Free Favour, and hence learn to humble my ſelf before him to nothing; ſeeing my Happineſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in thoſe free Beams of his Favour, <hi>in the light of his Countenance,</hi> in his ſetting my Soul into a gracious Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by his Spirit, and raiſing the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of my Spirit to a high commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him in Bliſs; for ſeeing I can ſo little yield my ſelf the accounts of Happineſs, and receive them all from him, and can ſo little move my ſelf upon them, when they are offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him, I am inconceivably bound and beholden to him, both to open <hi>the Fountain of Life</hi> (that is himſelf) to me, and to move me by his Spirit, that I may move.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, If he leaves me to my ſelf, what Evils ſhall I run in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to? and treaſure up torment, and ſharpen ſtings againſt my ſelf by it; and how can he inflame my Soul with his Indignation? and to what degrees he pleaſes, both now and for ever: For if he hide the face of his Mercy,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:179741:158"/> who can behold him? What Reaſon have I therefore to reverence him with Godly Fear, and to acknowledge him with greateſt dependency! I humbly therefore ſay, as the Apoſtle, <hi>not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by the Grace of God, I am what I am;</hi> but by the Grace of God alone, I hope, what I hope to be.</p>
            <p n="5">5. I hereby underſtand, what a great neceſſity I have of Jeſus Chriſt my Lord, the Son of the Wiſdom, Glory, Power, and Holineſs of God, the Son of his Love; for he is the Attonement, <hi>His Blood offered by the Eternal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> is the moſt excellent Thing in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or Earth, and that only which <hi>can purge the Conſcience;</hi> the moſt excellent and divine Inſtrument of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cification with God, and within the Conſcience it ſelf: Through him <hi>the Holy Spirit is given,</hi> by him is there an entrance into <hi>that Holy of Holies,</hi> that Heaven <hi>within the Veil;</hi> for as the value of Souls for which our Lord gave himſelf exalts his Redemption, the greatneſs of the Miſery from which they are reſcued, the greatneſs of the Happineſs to which they are exalted, all glorifie the Saviour of Souls; ſo do theſe Souls, of a Nature ſo ſupreme,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:179741:159"/> require ſo great a Ranſom and Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, no lower, no leſſer a Price can countervail them; and it argues them to be a Nature ſo ſupreme, that ſo great a Mediator undertook ſo infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely for them.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Hereby I underſtand, the great and extreme Evil of ſin; for if the breaches and diſorders of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are ſo great arguments of the Evil of ſin; how much more the breaches, the wounds, the horrours of Conſcience! There had never been ſuch a Thing <hi>as a wounded Spirit,</hi> had it not been for ſin: There had been only perfect Peace, Glory, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Happineſs, Pleaſure, Joy and Bleſſedneſs of Spirit; ſin introduced Debaſement and Miſery.</p>
            <p n="7">7. I hereby underſtand, what a worthleſs inconſiderable Thing the World is, if truly eſtimated, becauſe it is neither that which can be, or ought to be the Happineſs of a Man, becauſe not the Happineſs of the Soul; and if God be pleaſed to raiſe any Soul above it, what can it be now? Indeed a Man may be quiet with it for a time, but the Soul ſet upon God, and Chriſt, and Eternal
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:179741:159"/> things, is ſet where it may reſt for E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; and it may be ſo highly ſet, and raiſed upward, that it may have no need of the World, nor of any thing in it; for in the greateſt want of it, even now in this life, the Spirit, born up by God, and Chriſt, by ſenſe of and intereſt in him, and Eternal Happineſs, will <hi>bear its infirmity;</hi> but becauſe this World can do nothing to help in the amazements of Conſcience, in the Agonies of Death, in the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of Eternity, wherein can it ſerve us? <hi>But Godlineſs hath the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 8.</note> 
               <hi>of this life, and of that which is to come; Now our meat and drink may be to do Gods will,</hi> much more will it be the perfect enjoyment of Eternity.</p>
            <p>This World then, and the life we live in it, is only of uſe <hi>to make friends of, that we may be received into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Habitations, to ſow to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit with;</hi> to caſt this life, and all the intereſts of it, <hi>as a Corn of Wheat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> 
               <note place="margin">John 12. 24, 25.</note> 
               <hi>the ground; for except it dye into a higher, and more excellent life,</hi> it abides alone; we know the utmoſt can be made of it, it can never riſe higher, than it is, and all that can be
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:179741:160"/> made of it, the total account is <hi>but dying, unhappy man,</hi> but being thus ſown, it riſes in a flouriſh much more excellent, <hi>and brings forth fruit unto Eternal life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. Hereby I underſtand the ſtate of this World, and of all men in it, and their Motion, even as I underſtand how the Happineſs or Miſery of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity lyes: For when I think of Thoughts, Memory, Affections, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, always and for ever in act and motion; either upon the Conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or Terrours of God; and thoſe Powers or Motions inwardly Good and Holy, or Evil and Wicked, ſo is Happineſs or Miſery.</p>
            <p>So when I ſee in the World ſuch an even poiſe, as there is between the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous life of Grace and Comfort, and the ſuppreſſions of it, through ſo great concernedneſs either in the pleaſures, or afflictions of this preſent life, in Good Men; I herein ſee, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, God doth not call out the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to thoſe high and illuſtrious Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Grace, that are proper to ſo excellent a ſtate as Grace is; and hence I conclude, the ſtrength and enjoyment of Good Men is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:179741:160"/> to what it might be upon ſo excellent Principles.</p>
            <p>Again, On the other ſide, when I ſee a like poiſe in the ſtate of Evil Men, between the Trouble and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiets of this World, and the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of it, between ſome ſecret Fears of a future State, and the inſenſible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it; I plainly apprehend, the Patience of God preſerves Men from thoſe Horrours they are ſo every way capable of.</p>
            <p>And when either of theſe Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are brought near to an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or full correſpondence with thoſe Principles, upon which they are fixed; that is, to thoſe Joys un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable and full of Glory, or to thoſe Woes and Agonies of Mind that cannot be eaſed, they approach nearer to what they ſhall be For Ever. And from both theſe I collect the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a Future and Everlaſting State.</p>
            <p n="9">9. I hereby underſtand, what it is to loſe a Soul: It is not to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged and acquitted from a Soul, to be as the Beaſts, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to be <hi>as the Heathens about them.</hi> How glad would wicked men be at
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:179741:161"/> laſt, if this could be? if their Spirits might go downward, if they could be rolled up into utter ſenſeleſneſs, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come nothing; if Rocks might fall upon them, <hi>and the Mountains cover them.</hi> But this cannot be, Men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be Beaſts, though they deſire it; <hi>God hath known them above all the reſidue of this lower Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and brings them to a reckoning ſo exact, that none can be loſt in this ſenſe: The number of Souls cannot be leſſened or wanting.</p>
            <p>The loſs then of a Soul is to be loſt from true Beauty, Excellency, and Goodneſs, to have an abhorred Defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, ſo that they cannot endure to behold themſelves, who have loſt the Image of God. If ever any Man did recoil from himſelf, beholding an ug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, where naturally ſhould be a Beauty; or did abhor himſelf, being confounded with the ſenſe of his own unworthy Actions; the height here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is in Hell, both the Deformity, and the Apprehenſion of it: And this is one degree of the loſs of a Soul, its horrible degradation from it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Further, It is to be loſt from Life and Bleſſedneſs, into an Eternity of
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:179741:161"/> Woe and Miſery; as a Man is loſt that is taken Captive, and made a Slave, that is condemned to the Mines or Gallies; to be for Ever the Captive of Juſtice, the Slave of the Wrath and Juſtice of God. This is the loſs of a Soul; and it is the greateſt loſs, like the loſs of the Eyes to the Body, or the loſs of Life it ſelf; in compariſon of which Riches are nothing; a loſs that a Man would redeem with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Worlds, and the Pleaſures of ſo many Worlds heaped together, and inſtead thereof undergo the ſevereſt mortification of many Ages of life, and ſuffer Martyrdoms repeated with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out number, that he might recover the loſt Jewel, his Soul.</p>
            <p>And to conclude, It is the worſt way of loſing, by which a Soul is loſt, it is a loſing it by ſin and wickedneſs; not like loſing life in a Noble Cauſe, wherein a Man periſhes with Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur and Majeſty. <hi>Hoc tantùm nobile feci, quòd perii.</hi> Not ſo well as lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing what we value by meer misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, but as a Man, that by Gaming and Debauchery loſes his Eſtate, or by Treaſon and abhorred wickedneſs, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes both Life and Honour together.</p>
            <pb n="308" facs="tcp:179741:162"/>
            <p>There is no way of loſing a Soul, but by wickedneſs, which makes it always a moſt accurſed loſs: And they that are ſo loſt are an abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of God, Good Angels, Holy Souls, and even of themſelves; like the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſes</hi> ſpoken of by <hi>Eſay</hi> the Prophet, <hi>Whoſe Worm, bred out of themſelves, dyes not, and the fire prepared to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume them is not quenched; and they are for Ever an abhorring of all Fleſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, From theſe juſt Meaſures I have in the former Diſcourſe given of a Soul, I find very ſatisfactory ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions to thoſe Pretences, that are thought ſo mighty, againſt the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Reſurrection. For when I conſider, that Body and Matter are always flowing, and in a continual va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation, that they are not ſtable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to be much valuable in making up the perſon of a Man, I eaſily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge that Honour due to a more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and excellent Being within; for if we reſpect a Body diſtinctly, who can give an account of the daily De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cays and Reparations, the Acceſſions and Diminutions of it, the alterations of it in its aſcendency from Infancy
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:179741:162"/> to Youth, from Youth to Manhood, the gradual declinations of it into Old Age? Yet we ſtill account it the ſame Perſon, though it cannot be in a diſtinct ſenſe the ſame Body; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt be the conjunction with the ſame never growing, never decrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Soul, that makes it eſteemed the ſame. I then collect, whatever of Matter is aſſumed into a Vital Union with the Soul, and fitted for its ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, is truly called its Body; and do we not find, the Soul hath the ſame love for the new parts of Matter, that daily accrue to it, ſo long as they continue in conjunction with it? and that it loſes its love to thoſe parts of Matter, before united with it, aſſoon as they are looſed, and flye from it: It imprints rationality upon them by its own uſe of them, and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come wild, irrational, and inſenſible again in their departure from it; they are as guilty, as Matter can be, when the Soul vitiouſly inſpires them; and as virtuous, as Bodily parts can be, when it uſes them in virtuous Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; the Soul is puniſhed, when they being united with it are in diſorder, and finds pleaſure in their eaſe, and
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:179741:163"/> good condition. It is yet indifferent to Matter it ſelf, whether the parts of it burn in a Feaver, or are in the moſt equal temper, and ſo through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the varieties of Bodily State; and it is as indifferent to the Soul, whether theſe material particles are of its older or newer aſſumption into the participations of its own life, and reſentment; its care for, and concern in them is all one. This then being laid, as a certain ground, (for I think it cannot be denyed) that the ſame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Soul retains with it ſelf the whole account of the ſameneſs of the perſon, no man need intangle himſelf in unneceſſary ſcruples concerning the Reſurrection, or think the Wounds of Atheiſm deep, and incurable, upon this point of Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>For firſt, Let us take that, which ſeems the moſt natural ſenſe of the Apoſtles Diſcourſe of this point, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 36, 37, 38. That the dying Body is as <hi>Seed thrown into the Earth,</hi> which <note place="margin">Joh. 12. 24.</note> 
               <hi>dyes,</hi> that is diſſolves, and melts as it were into the Earth, and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates its ſeminal virtue to it, and from thence it riſes in the very ſame kind of Body, though with much advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:179741:163"/> and flouriſh of Nature; we may then conceive a great part of the whole lump or univerſe of Matter, communicated with the ſeminal vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Humane Bodies, full of that <hi>Vis plaſtica,</hi> which lyes hid and dead now. But as God doth, according to the ſeveral Seaſons of his own appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, raiſe out of the Earth the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Seeds, ſo doth he, in that great Period, or Harveſt of the World, draw out of the whole Plot of Nature, the Bodies of every Man, Woman, and Child, the ſeminal virtue of which remain all along, though conceal'd; And as the riſing again of Seeds in common Nature, in the main follows the kind of Seeds dying into the Earth, ſo it is in this higher and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Reſurrection: Yet there are very great variations of circumſtances too, between the Seeds ſown, and their ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing again, ſo there is in this Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; inſomuch that, though there is certainly ſo much as to diſtinguiſh and appropriate every mans Body to himſelf, and ſo much, that a vitious, unclean, and unſanctified Body ſown ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the ſame; and a holy purified Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, made the <hi>Temple of the Holy</hi>
               <pb n="312" facs="tcp:179741:164"/> 
               <hi>Ghoſt,</hi> riſes ſuch; and this latter with advantage, and that ſo great, that the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>We know not what we</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 2.</note> 
               <hi>ſhall be, only this we know, we ſhall be like him, for we ſhall ſee him as he is:</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> reſolves it into this, <hi>God gives a Body as it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes him;</hi> a Body ſpiritual, incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and immortal, <hi>conformed to the glorious Body of the Son of God,</hi> and ſo united with the Soul for Ever.</p>
            <p>And further than this, to approach in a more ſtrict and literal ſenſe to the Article of the Reſurrection. In all the revolutions of Matter, out of one ſhape into another, or the viciſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of it in the Bodies of Men, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring firſt into the Body of one Man, then of another, there is yet no loſs of Matter, the Omniſciency of God keeps it all under a ſtrict account, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhes it all; his Omnipotency preſerves and diſpoſes it, he knows how, and is able, to ſummon it from every corner; there can then be no want of any particle of any man, and however ſome of the ſame Matter may have been common to many Men, yet we may with eaſe conceive ſome ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial parts of all Humane Bodies
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:179741:164"/> kept ſo diſtinct by God, as to make up out of them to every Man his own Body, at the Reſurrection, in as full a ſenſe, as <hi>Eve</hi> was made of the <hi>Rib of</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gen. 2. 22.</note> 
               <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>taken out of Man;</hi> for we cannot ſuppoſe that done without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny addition, but that God made that the Foundation, and built upon it by his own Omnipotency; and yet the whole was ſo like <hi>Adam,</hi> that he knew <hi>Eve was Bone of his Bone, Fleſh</hi> 
               <note place="margin">v. 23.</note> 
               <hi>of his Fleſh;</hi> even ſo the Soul ſhall know its own Body, notwithſtanding any alteration or addition: And how little an addition needs in the making up a ſpiritual Body? Reſurrection is too great a Myſtery to ſearch into; but this is plain, The ſame Soul with ſo much the ſame Body, much eaſes the Doctrine of the Reſurrection to our Thoughts.</p>
            <p>Nor do I intend this ſhould be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, as the leaſt intimation, that there is not further proof from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, reconcileable with the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of true Reaſon, to aſcertain this Article of Chriſtian Faith, in the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt latitude it is aſſerted by the Church; but I have only taken ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage from the greatneſs of the Soul,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:179741:165"/> to ſhew how far the Doctrine of the Reſurrection may be verified againſt the boldeſt infidelious <hi>Sadducee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There remains nothing then, but a general review of the ſtate of the Soul in theſe Bodies of the Reſurrection; upon which I have made frequent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marques already, and ſhall only give now this brief Recapitulation.</p>
            <p>The Bodies of that future ſtate are ſo proportioned and qualified, that they do not at all damp the lively o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations of a bleſſed, and for ever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed, or, the enraged motions of a diſturbed and tormented Mind. The Bodies of the <hi>Saints</hi> are fitted to the choice and beatifying Action of their Souls; and thoſe of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,</hi> have ſuch kind of Bodies, as give way to the play of a Conſcience, full of the ſtings of guilt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes of Juſtice; of the horrours of ſin, and reſtleſs Exagitations of it ſelf; for could theſe motions be dulled by Bodies, there would neither be ſcope for Divine Mercy, nor Juſtice, in the other World: But then it is, that the Bodies of Men are prepared for the greateſt capacities of Pleaſure or Pain, Fine to take in every intimation
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:179741:165"/> of either, of freeſt reception and ſtrength to endure, and bear, in a ſtate of immortality and incorruption to laſt; which is the difference between the preſent ſtate of Bodies, and the future; for even an Exceſs of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure here gluts and overcharges Bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Nature, and oppreſſes it; from pain and preſſure it vaniſhes, or is ground to Powder by it: But this immortal ſtate of Bodies is filled with Happineſs, Pleaſure, and Delight, and yet thoſe Bodies not ſurcharged; and full of Unhappineſs and Miſery, yet they abide by it, ſhrink not from, but rejoin themſelves to all they endure, having put on immortality.</p>
            <p>Now this Miſery and Unhappineſs of the Body ariſes firſt from the guilt, and confuſion of the Soul, that falls upon it; even as we ſee the ſorrow of the Mind here in the World, prints it ſelf upon the outward Man; and the ſhame and ſecret confuſions of guilt, of which the Mind is full, diffuſe themſelves upon the whole ſurface of exterior Nature, and make the aſpect mean and confounded: On the other ſide, the Peace, Righteouſneſs, and Heavenly Joy of the Saints break out,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:179741:166"/> and illuſtrate their Bodies; even as we ſee now a chearful Heart makes a Countenance full of Light, and a good frame of Soul beautifies the whole Man; <hi>A Mans Wiſdom now makes his Face to ſhine,</hi> and in Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity the clearneſs ſhall not be only doubled, but in endleſs degrees grow brighter, even to the brightneſs <hi>of the Sun,</hi> for ſo they <hi>ſhall ſhine out in the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Matt. 13. 43.</note> 
               <hi>Kingdom of their Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Bodies of Saints have a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Happineſs and Glory, beſides that which flows from the Soul; and it is that by which Almighty Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Wiſdom fits them to the ſtate of the Soul; a <hi>Faſhioning</hi> there is of Bodies like <hi>to the Glorious Body</hi> of Chriſt, which returns with greateſt delight and ſatisfaction upon the Soul: On the contrary, the Bodies of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men not accompliſhed with that Glory, but puniſhed with a deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, increaſe the unhappineſs and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Soul. We ſee the Soul now takes pleaſure in the grace and happy order of its Body, and is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by any thing loathſom, and to be abhorred in it: This will be much more in the unchangeable ſtate; God
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:179741:166"/> ſo diſpoſing, that the Soul and Body lye cloſer, and nearer one to another; and the paſſes and reciprocations of Good and Evil are much freer, and more penetrating; and therefore Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Hell are ſo often deſcribed in Scripture by things proper to Bodies, becauſe they are moſt ſenſible to us now; and becauſe too the Happineſs or Miſery (though it be for the Souls ſake alone, originally and principally, yet) as far as the Nature of Body u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited to the Soul extends, do fully and on every ſide inclaſp, and encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs Bodies, as well as Souls for Ever.</p>
